Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.38,0:09:33.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.37,0:09:38.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Then as soon as the deliverymen open the door, let's have them get us out!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.93,0:09:39.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Yeah!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.60,0:09:42.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}No, we probably shouldn't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.52,0:09:48.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Looks like there was already a passenger before we came here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.64,0:09:58.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}What's the meaning of this?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.52,0:09:59.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Beats me.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.16,0:10:04.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I don't know who he is, or why he was killed,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.43,0:10:10.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}but the ones who did it were probably the deliverymen from earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.66,0:10:12.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Seriously?!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.91,0:10:16.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}But why's he in the cargo area?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.84,0:10:19.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Because of the cooling equipment.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.37,0:10:25.98,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,{\blur1}Once they put the body in here, the decomposition rate decreases and the estimated time of death will be later than it really is.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.77,0:10:30.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}After that, all they have to do is drop the body somewhere, so that even if it's discovered,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.44,0:10:35.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}they can just claim they were working at the time of the crime!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.79,0:10:42.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}They wanted to make the addressees remember their names and faces by dropping the packages at the entrances
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.38,0:10:48.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}so they could testify to the cops saying 'that deliveryman {\i1}did{\i0} hand me the package at the time'.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.14,0:10:53.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}And if they keep asking to use the toilets at corner shops, they'll appear on surveillance cameras and have alibis.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.54,0:10:57.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}They can just say they had an upset stomach and won't be suspected.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.14,0:11:00.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Besides, look at this.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.39,0:11:08.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}The cardboard box carrying the body has dented corners and smudged sides, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.12,0:11:14.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Which means they rolled the box along with the body over and over periodically to slow down rigor mortis.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.42,0:11:16.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.48,0:11:19.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So if those two find us...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.66,0:11:20.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.02,0:11:27.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}They'll probably kill all five of us and lock us in here.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.37,0:11:29.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}N-No way!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.89,0:11:32.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Can't we do something?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.03,0:11:35.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Like rushing out the door as soon as they open it!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:35.79,0:11:36.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}That's no good.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.13,0:11:45.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Our bodies are numb from the cold, so I don't think we'd be able to escape soon enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.37,0:11:47.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Well, no need to worry.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.11,0:11:52.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}How about we deliver those two ourselves?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.87,0:11:55.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}To prison, that is.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.57,0:12:10.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So, what do we do?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.55,0:12:14.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}How are we going to catch those two deliverymen?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.34,0:12:16.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Tell us, Conan-{\i1}kun{\i0}!
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.44,0:12:19.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}We won't be the ones doing the catching.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.51,0:12:21.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}We'll leave that to somebody else.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.02,0:12:28.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Just use a mobile phone to call Detective Takagi at the Police HQ.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.45,0:12:35.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}We'll tell him that bad guys from Cheetah Delivery Service are carrying a dead body inside the refrigerated compartment,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:35.89,0:12:38.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}and that we're locked inside it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.85,0:12:43.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Then ask him to set up a police cordon, and investigate the cargo area as the truck stops.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.32,0:12:48.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I memorised this refrigerated truck's plate number, so we're all set.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.25,0:12:49.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}What?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:49.56,0:12:50.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}A phone call?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.72,0:12:53.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I thought you had a more ingenious idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.01,0:12:59.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Under these circumstances, isn't that all we can do?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.74,0:13:00.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Yeah!
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.78,0:13:03.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So would one of you please lend me your mobile?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.64,0:13:06.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I left mine charging at the doc's place.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.78,0:13:09.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I left mine at the doctor's, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.27,0:13:12.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Me too, I didn't wanna drop it when playing football.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.74,0:13:28.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}You can {\i1}do{\i0} that?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:28.52,0:13:29.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.42,0:13:34.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Just gotta take out the battery and warm it with my body temperature.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.51,0:13:37.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}The voltage will rise and we can use it for a small while.
