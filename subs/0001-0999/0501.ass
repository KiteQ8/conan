Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.40,0:06:47.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You think we should leave all those people who helped the FBI alone?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.03,0:06:51.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They weren't helping them, it seems.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.95,0:06:57.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The FBI claimed I was Akai Shuuichi's sister to have me admitted.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.41,0:07:00.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, aren't you a famous announcer?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.08,0:07:04.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They had to say I resembled her a number of times.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.67,0:07:08.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They also said that if I were really her, the media would have been all over the incident.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.84,0:07:15.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, the FBI asked many others to help cover up my being unaccounted for.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.56,0:07:17.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why, Kir?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.31,0:07:20.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why do you care what becomes of that hospital?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.98,0:07:23.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Is something there?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.15,0:07:25.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Not really.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.27,0:07:30.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For some reason or other, I just don't wish to kill the people who took care of me...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.20,0:07:32.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I wouldn't really enjoy it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.49,0:07:42.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, if the employees in that hospital were cooperating with the FBI and knew the Organization was coming to rescue me...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.04,0:07:45.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think they would have come up with some countermeasures.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.55,0:07:48.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For now, we won't act.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.17,0:07:49.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just as you wish.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.13,0:07:53.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's difficult to swallow.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.76,0:07:59.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That Akai set up a plan that allowed us to retrieve Kir so easily.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.89,0:08:03.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There must be something behind it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.40,0:08:08.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Speaking of that guy, it's a shame we weren't able to kill him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.07,0:08:09.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.53,0:08:16.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I figured he would certainly interfere as soon as we recovered Kir.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.53,0:08:20.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Doesn't that mean this is all he can do?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.61,0:08:50.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She was CIA, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.57,0:08:52.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That announcer, Mizunashi Rena...
