Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.12,0:05:29.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And that person who had been right there just disappeared!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.79,0:05:36.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Bet they just used remote control to induce a blackout and fled.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.59,0:05:40.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, I wouldn't have come all the way here to\NTokyo if it was only that person who disappeared.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.72,0:05:44.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A piece of paper was left in the bathroom\Nwhere that person disappeared.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.19,0:05:57.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What does that mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.44,0:06:04.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,On the tiles near the head of the person who was leaning\Nagainst the wall, something was carved with possibly a knife.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.03,0:06:04.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.91,0:06:06.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.33,0:06:07.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Three letters of the English alphabet...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.83,0:06:24.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Both those letters and the person disappeared, but\Non the paper it said that the letters didn't disappear.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.51,0:06:29.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, didn't they just switch the tiles\Nwith some that weren't scratched?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.43,0:06:34.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's true that on the tiles near the bottom\Nof the wall were a lot of scratches...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.40,0:06:36.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So that's what I thought too at first...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.94,0:06:42.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the color of those tiles got gradually\Nlighter from top of the wall to bottom...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.11,0:06:47.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So even if someone had swapped the bottom tiles with the top ones,it would've been immediately apparent due to the color difference.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.78,0:06:50.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you go and take a look at the tiles as well, Heiji-niichan?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.95,0:06:51.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.29,0:06:58.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But a whole mess of construction workers were there, saying\Nthe house was scheduled to be rebuilt starting that day.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.54,0:07:00.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They wouldn't let me into the house!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.78,0:07:04.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, for about how long were the lights out?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.59,0:07:06.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was probably less than five minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.51,0:07:11.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In that case, they probably had them prepared...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.31,0:07:14.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Tiles with the same colors as those that were carved.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.52,0:07:21.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's safe to assume that they switched them in the darkness, and\Ntook away with them the tiles that had the letters engraved.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.86,0:07:25.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it's just a dumb trick, so what?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.03,0:07:26.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally you'd think so, right!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.82,0:07:28.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But here's the real issue at hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.53,0:07:34.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The crime scene where Wakamatsu{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} was stabbed to death\Nin Karuizawa was a bathroom with the same kind of tiles.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.04,0:07:41.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the body was first discovered, there should've been a\Ndying message there that he had written with his blood...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.50,0:07:44.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But from what I heard, it had completely\Ndisappeared when the police came.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.80,0:07:47.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The dying message...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.72,0:07:48.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Disappeared?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.18,0:07:54.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wakamatsu{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s finger had blood adhered to it, so\Nit's clear that he should have written something.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.52,0:07:55.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't you find the absence odd?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.27,0:08:00.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wouldn't the culprit have just snuck back\Ninto the scene, noticed it and wiped it off?
