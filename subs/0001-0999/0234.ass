Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.27,0:09:54.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means Doyle wasn't waiting\Nin the Japanese room at noon.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.57,0:10:01.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rather, he remembers that if he sits on his usual cushion\Nnear where the chime is, he will get a snack.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.04,0:10:08.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Knowing that, the culprit used it to\Nhis advantage to get the dog here.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.79,0:10:50.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit removed the sound absorbing material\Nthat filled the speaker's interior in advance.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.46,0:10:56.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Doyle's favorite cushion was then placed in\Nthat space, along with a piece of cheese.
