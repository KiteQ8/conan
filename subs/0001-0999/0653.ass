Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.48,0:07:47.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So either the capsule was dropped into the black tea to\Ndispose of the evidence after the poison inside was used up...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.98,0:07:52.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Or as you suggested it was possibly a fake\Nintended to confuse our investigation.
