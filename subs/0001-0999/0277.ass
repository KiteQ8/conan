Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.18,0:03:50.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,she'd lock herself in the house and never leave.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.27,0:03:54.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, I promised her...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.90,0:03:59.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,that I'd take care of things if something happened, so I don't want to worry her.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.47,0:04:02.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why I don't want her to worry.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.47,0:04:06.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So where's Haibara right now?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.68,0:04:10.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think she's in the lab downstairs.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.10,0:04:35.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Huh? What about?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.40,0:04:40.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Whoever stole the files was especially careful to return them,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.75,0:04:42.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,with a sealed letter{in a sealed envelope?} to Metro Police...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.12,0:04:48.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They probably returned the files because they were done looking through them, don't you think?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.14,0:04:49.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't be silly.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.34,0:04:52.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wouldn't they rather have discarded them when they were done looking through them?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.11,0:04:57.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why would they go out of their way to send the files back and breed more suspicion?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.04,0:05:00.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're probably right...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.14,0:05:01.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The most likely explanation
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.80,0:05:07.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,is that they are trying to relay a defiant message, "We're already on to all your tricks."
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.04,0:05:08.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Or...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:10.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They're trying to lure someone outta hiding into some kinda trap.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.55,0:05:14.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, in this case the opponent they're trying to lure out
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.15,0:05:17.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,would be you, Kudo...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.05,0:05:19.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Probably.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.14,0:05:23.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But what I don't get is, if it {\i1}is{\i0} a trap,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.55,0:05:27.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,then why're they going about it in such a complicated way?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.00,0:05:28.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.41,0:05:31.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's lots of ways to lure someone out...

Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.80,0:05:41.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,W-What the hell are you doing here, Hattori?!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.95,0:05:44.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This old man rung me up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.11,0:05:49.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He said if I, your {\i1}best friend{\i0}, came, I could help you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.24,0:05:55.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nah... I just didn't want Shin'ichi worrying about this problem all by himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.44,0:05:59.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But I guess we're dealing with something{oh geez} like grasping at clouds,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.45,0:06:01.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so there's not much we can do...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.79,0:06:03.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're naïve, old man.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.06,0:06:06.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As long as Kudo's kept quiet about such an important story,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.58,0:06:10.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,he wouldn't start talking openly about it out of nowhere, would he?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.49,0:06:13.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He's got his hands on some important clue.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.73,0:06:17.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe he's found a clue he can strike back at them with.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.88,0:06:25.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm right, ain't I? C'mon, admit it, I hit the bullseye!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.85,0:06:29.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, do you remember what I told you before,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.73,0:06:33.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,that I had a brush with them at the Haido City Hotel?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.78,0:06:36.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. You went there with that little girl named Haibara,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.82,0:06:41.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and hunted down that old guy named Pisco, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.34,0:06:42.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.80,0:06:45.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I've been wondering for a while...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.03,0:06:48.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why did Pisco have the handkerchief of the party,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.97,0:06:52.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,which he wasn't supposed to have, when he was questioned at the police station?
