Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.70,0:06:55.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Anyway, look carefully at those three over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.66,0:06:59.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They're famous high-school athletes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.96,0:07:04.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The one on the right is Goto Yousuke, a dependable southpaw who took his team to the Koushien semi-finals.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.42,0:07:09.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In the middle is Nakajima Keita, a backstroke swimmer who set a record at the inter-high competition.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.39,0:07:14.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,On the left is Maeda Kazuhiko, a renowned soccer player who's under seventeen.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.27,0:07:17.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't you notice something?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.81,0:07:28.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, the carrier is left-handed, wears his bag on his left shoulder, and either swims, plays baseball, or plays soccer?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.74,0:07:34.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then it's the soccer player! He's wearing it over his left shoulder.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.41,0:07:37.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think that's just a coincidence.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.75,0:07:38.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why...?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.42,0:07:46.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, it could be the swimmer, but you'd have to ask the person to find out their dominant hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.05,0:07:49.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I've got it! It's the baseball player!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.84,0:07:52.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Southpaw means left-handed, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.72,0:07:54.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So that means it's gotta be the baseball player!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.56,0:07:56.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Him being left-handed is probably a coincidence, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.31,0:07:58.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But still...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.73,0:08:03.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's weird for him to have his bag on his right shoulder.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.86,0:08:05.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're right! But why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.53,0:08:10.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe he used to throw with his right arm but switched to his left.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.53,0:08:12.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means he used to be right-handed.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.20,0:08:14.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's not it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.66,0:08:18.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That isn't the reason he's wearing the bag on his right side.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.50,0:08:21.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It goes back to what I said earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.00,0:08:25.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,About what's taboo for sports players.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.01,0:08:33.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He has to protect that shoulder, get it?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.05,0:08:36.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Now that you mention it, I've heard of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.56,0:08:43.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Pitchers keep heavy things off of their dominant shoulder to avoid damaging it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.31,0:08:45.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Genta, that guy you saw was a right-handed pitcher, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.11,0:08:49.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yep, he was doing it just like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.74,0:08:54.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he's a right-handed pitcher still playing baseball,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.66,0:09:02.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's highly likely that that's why he's using his left shoulder.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.29,0:09:05.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But can you be sure with just this?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.67,0:09:09.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The soccer player and swimmer could be left-handed, too, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.96,0:09:11.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm actually pretty sure.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.23,0:09:22.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.69,0:09:26.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, Mouri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} was using this earlier on his glove!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.24,0:09:33.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's glove oil, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.82,0:09:37.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then we can be sure this bag belongs to...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.66,0:09:42.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The baseball player wearing the hat. No doubt about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.29,0:09:46.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But still, how're we going to find this guy?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.83,0:09:50.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even more people are here now than before.
