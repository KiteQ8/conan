Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.29,0:06:43.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why did they pick us up?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.90,0:06:49.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, ordinary carjackers wouldn't stop to pick up hitchhikers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.98,0:06:53.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But they did, to pass through checkpoints.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.23,0:07:00.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The police wouldn't suspect a group that had an old man and a child. We'd look like a family on an outing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.31,0:07:04.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's how I realized who they were.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.90,0:07:09.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The only ones who would give us a lift in a stolen car...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.23,0:07:50.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We'll need you to stick around with us a while longer then...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.54,0:08:04.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, where do you think we should\Nget rid of this old man and the kid?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.67,0:08:06.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let's see...
