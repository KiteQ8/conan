Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.15,0:03:04.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What?! A man was killed under police surveillance?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.83,0:03:05.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.87,0:03:11.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Last month, a man in his seventies passed away in a flat in Haido Town.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.58,0:03:18.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That man, named Hidemichi Mizuki, was a high school teacher until a few years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.67,0:03:22.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,One of his students was a man named Kiriya Hido.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.76,0:03:26.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I've heard the name "Kiriya Hido" somewhere before...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.56,0:03:33.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He's the serial killer behind two deaths in Ōsaka and one in Kōbe.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.73,0:03:41.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We got a report he'd been sighted in Tōkyō, so in a joint operation with the Tōkyō Police, we put Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s flat under surveillance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.78,0:03:49.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We figured that since Hido had no relatives, if he'd turn to anyone for help, it'd be Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}, who used to look out for him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.70,0:03:56.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And then, on the morning of the stakeout's third day, he didn't come out for his usual morning walk.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.34,0:04:00.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We thought it was strange, so we went to check his room,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.59,0:04:07.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and a rope had been put through the AC vents in the living room and used to hang Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.51,0:04:12.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then isn't that just a suicide?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.85,0:04:16.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You were watching his front door and windows, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.31,0:04:21.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's why we closed the case as a suicide, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.44,0:04:25.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The tips of his toes seemed strangely far from the ground,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.28,0:04:29.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were about the same height as the top of my legs.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.33,0:04:33.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And surprisingly, the chair lying at his feet was...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.29,0:04:37.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,...exactly the same as the ones we got in my kitchen at home!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.13,0:04:41.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Those chairs were only made in a limited amount quite some time ago, and they were all the same size.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.13,0:04:46.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When we tried measuring one against Ōtaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-han{\r},
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.05,0:04:51.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,we found there'd be at least 10 centimetres between the chair and the tips of his toes!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.06,0:04:57.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, with a 10 centimetre gap, he couldn't have hanged himself even if he stretched!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.15,0:04:58.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.31,0:05:08.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Which means that the chair was just a trick by the killer to make it look like Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} killed himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.07,0:05:09.70,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.70,0:05:13.08,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}That's why the victim was "short on both legs and help".
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.37,0:05:16.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,His door wasn't even locked either,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.92,0:05:18.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so it's gotta be a murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.83,0:05:23.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then could it have been that Kiriya Hido guy, the serial killer?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.63,0:05:25.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.22,0:05:29.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Kiriya Hido's already been caught in Hiroshima.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.14,0:05:32.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Apparently he'd been staying in an Internet café for the past month.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.89,0:05:36.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the police were watching the place, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.73,0:05:40.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if the door was open, how did the killer manage to get in unseen?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.94,0:05:44.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Exactly. Due to the circumstances, the murder scene was already sealed off.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.40,0:05:50.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We got permission from his relatives,\Nso we're about to go and check his flat...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.32,0:05:52.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So I figured you guys would wanna go too, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.33,0:06:01.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the flat where the crime took place has been left just as it was at the time of the incident, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.25,0:06:02.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.21,0:06:07.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Though the daughter of the victim said she'd be comin' by tomorrow to pick up her father's items.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.09,0:06:11.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, as long as we figure out how the killer got in today, that ain't no problem!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.72,0:06:15.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Look, Ran{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r}! This lift has windows!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.35,0:06:18.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Lifts with windows in the doors are actually pretty common.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.48,0:06:22.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Stop messin' around, you two.\NWe ain't goin' there for a friendly visit!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.48,0:06:23.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I know that!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.40,0:06:28.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,'Cause I got a special role here that only I can do!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.53,0:06:31.28,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}A special role?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.33,0:06:39.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No doubt about it! This chair is just like the ones we got at home!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.16,0:06:41.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's got exactly the same colour and design!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.75,0:06:45.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This case is definitely fishy, Heiji!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:48.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's what I've been sayin'.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.09,0:06:50.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mission accomplished!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.01,0:06:57.43,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}We could've just measured the height of the chair, you didn't have to be here, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.43,0:07:03.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the problem now is figuring out how the killer slipped past the police when coming in and out.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.69,0:07:07.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There might be some secret exit...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.07,0:07:12.66,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Just like Inspector Ōtaki said, the rope was passed through the AC vents...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.70,0:07:15.70,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}There's something directly under the rope.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.16,0:07:19.04,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Pencil sharpenings?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.58,0:07:25.92,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}It looks like the man living here liked to use pencils.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.96,0:07:30.92,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}But why would there be a pile of sharpenings lying here?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.92,0:07:37.31,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}It's obvious from looking around that he was a neat freak —\hhe even had a cleaning robot!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.01,0:07:42.14,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}And that rubbish bin lying on its side in the corner...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.89,0:07:45.81,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}If he was a neat freak, he wouldn't have just ignored it...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.36,0:07:49.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, Hattori.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.28,0:07:51.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could this actually be...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.70,0:07:53.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.03,0:07:54.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The answer's probably this thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.49,0:07:57.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, Heiji!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.53,0:08:00.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What are you doin', turnin' that thing on?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.37,0:08:02.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Solvin' the mystery.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.25,0:08:08.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} didn't stand on the chair when he hanged himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.75,0:08:11.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He used this long and thin bin!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.72,0:08:19.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He placed it right under the rope, and probably turned it over to make it easier to stand on.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.39,0:08:25.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As proof of that, you can see pencil sharpenings lying on the floor here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.65,0:08:30.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The stuff stuck at the bottom of the bin fell out when he turned it over.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.44,0:08:32.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Look.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.32,0:08:36.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you used this, it'd be higher than the chair and his feet would reach, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.36,0:08:40.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But Hei{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r}, that wasn't like that when we were here before...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.00,0:08:44.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't worry about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.62,0:08:50.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When he hung himself, if he knocked over the bin so that it falls between the legs of the chair...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.67,0:09:01.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,...then you'd just need the cleanin' robot to push it into the corner before goin' back to its chargin' point,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.68,0:09:05.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and you'd end up with the weird crime scene we found.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.44,0:09:10.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As proof of this, the robot only cleans along this route.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.48,0:09:16.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He probably got the robot to remember the route by puttin' all sorts of obstructions along it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.41,0:09:19.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,H-Hold on!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.20,0:09:20.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then this case...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.95,0:09:25.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. However you look at it, it's just a suicide.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.04,0:09:31.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You okay, Heiji?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.88,0:09:34.71,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}You're {\i1}that{\i0} depressed?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.38,0:09:38.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why did Mizuki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} choose to die like that?
