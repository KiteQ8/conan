Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.91,0:06:50.25,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.25,0:06:53.50,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I remember he said that she was 'finally together with her love'
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.50,0:06:55.48,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and didn't even come to the class reunion.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.13,0:06:58.15,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Did she get married or something?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.15,0:07:01.42,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Nope, from seeing her here, what she meant by 'together'
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.42,0:07:05.91,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,was that she'd become a police officer under the same police district,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.91,0:07:08.40,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and she probably didn't come to the class reunion
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.40,0:07:12.70,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,because she thought Officer Chiba had forgotten about her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.70,0:07:16.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then, Officer Chiba just mistook it as a rejection?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.90,0:07:18.25,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.25,0:07:23.13,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And it seems he himself hasn't even realised that his first love,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.13,0:07:26.76,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Naeko Mi'ike-{\i1}san{\i0} is right in front of him.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.76,0:07:30.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Really... just like Officer Takagi and Inspector Shiratori...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.55,0:07:33.24,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,How come all the officers we know
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.24,0:07:37.19,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,have to be such slow, annoying, blockheaded morons?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.86,0:07:44.20,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I guess they have their hands so full with investigations that nothing else even enters their minds...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.20,0:07:45.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.21,0:07:47.03,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't ask me. How would I know?
