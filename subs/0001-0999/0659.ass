Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.15,0:07:01.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, from seeing her here, what she meant by 'together'
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.42,0:07:05.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,was that she'd become a police officer under the same police district,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.91,0:07:08.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and she probably didn't come to the class reunion
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.40,0:07:12.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,because she thought Officer Chiba had forgotten about her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.70,0:07:16.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, Officer Chiba just mistook it as a rejection?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.86,0:07:44.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, I guess they have their hands so full with investigations that nothing else even enters their minds...
