Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.90,0:05:07.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.94,0:05:10.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's just that Somei{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} has gotten involved in a trivial case.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.42,0:05:30.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you know who it was from?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.88,0:05:33.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure it was a woman.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.39,0:05:39.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maiko?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.27,0:05:44.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She was the one who came earlier with\NPresident Somei to the detective office.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.36,0:05:50.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So she telephoned President Somei at that time...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.57,0:05:56.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What's this?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.99,0:05:59.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could it be?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.95,0:06:06.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then the reason President Somei went into this room first was...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.13,0:06:08.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,His real objective was...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.13,0:06:17.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The aroma of coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.01,0:06:19.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's just as I thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.51,0:06:21.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So there's no body here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.76,0:06:24.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Say, was that window locked?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.02,0:06:25.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.94,0:06:29.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just to be sure we opened it and checked the veranda.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.02,0:06:31.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's really raining hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.69,0:06:33.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So don't open the window.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.91,0:06:39.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The window was closed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.28,0:06:43.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yet despite that, the lace curtain underneath is damp.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.16,0:06:45.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Come to think of it...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.46,0:06:47.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When President Somei stopped in front of the apartment building...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.83,0:06:49.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,His jacket was wet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.17,0:06:52.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So what was it like? That veranda?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.59,0:06:57.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could they have reached the next apartment or jumped down from it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.63,0:06:58.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No way, no way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.97,0:07:01.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The next door veranda is blocked off by a wall.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.14,0:07:06.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And there was no evidence that the emergency\Nladder was used to descend to the veranda below.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.68,0:07:08.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And most importantly, this is the 20th floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.02,0:07:11.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And no matter how few people might\Nbe in the parking lot directly below...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.23,0:07:17.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Using a rope or something to descend would be slow,\Nand somebody would notice them coming down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.20,0:07:21.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, they could have jumped off using\Na hang glider like Kaitou Kid, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.24,0:07:24.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This rain seems too intense for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.24,0:07:27.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In that case, there's only one answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.21,0:07:32.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The sad truth is the only one.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.76,0:07:39.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Excuse me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.18,0:07:43.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So would it be OK to let me leave soon?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.51,0:07:45.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's getting late after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.01,0:07:47.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And I'm still not feeling very well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.81,0:07:49.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, no, wait a bit longer please.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.65,0:07:53.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, did you get confirmation about his health?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.86,0:07:56.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I phoned President Somei's office.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.44,0:07:59.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems his stomach was bothering him...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.11,0:08:01.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And he took 2 or 3 days off of work also.
