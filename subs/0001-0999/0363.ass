Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.57,0:07:29.89,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So they took revenge on her because she\Nwent looking through the rubbish...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.64,0:07:42.20,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I see, the crows took revenge\Nbecause she stopped them eating!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.20,0:07:45.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's possible, because\Ncrows are really smart!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.30,0:07:49.82,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So the old lady made her usual rounds\Nto the rubbish dump this morning.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.24,0:08:20.85,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So why would she come this way when she was already at the entrance?

Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.44,0:08:34.45,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Actually, we thought that was strange too, when we first arrived.
