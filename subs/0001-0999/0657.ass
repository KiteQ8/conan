Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.06,0:05:08.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I asked them about that too, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.39,0:05:13.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems they were thinking, "We don't really know, but\Nwe can make it a good flower vase if it's for 500 yen."
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.36,0:05:19.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I asked them to examine it more thoroughly, but they said\Ntheir legs were falling asleep so they were going home.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.08,0:05:34.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Without touching the vase once, they used a\Nmagnifying glass and thoroughly examined it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.84,0:05:35.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.80,0:05:37.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What'did they say?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.26,0:05:44.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They said that it might be a really valuable vase, so they\Nrecommended that I take it to a professional appraiser.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.68,0:05:52.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they also said it'd be a good idea not to show it to the others\Nsince there might be bad people who'd want to drive down its value.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.40,0:05:54.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What about the third group?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.15,0:05:58.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were an extremely rude father and son!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.53,0:06:02.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having only touched the vase and peeked\Ninside for a split second, the son asked me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.66,0:06:06.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"How much do you think this is worth?"\Nwhile grinning like a Cheshire cat.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.58,0:06:12.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So I snapped and spat out "About 500,000 yen! If you\Nbuy it now, I'll even throw in the rug as a bonus!"
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.71,0:06:16.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the father wryly smiled and said, "You humor me."
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.00,0:06:19.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then both of them laughed and snorted, "People\Nwithout a discerning eye are pathetic, no?'
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.96,0:06:22.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why I got so mad that I ran them out!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.05,0:06:23.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.34,0:06:25.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Was Haibara nearby at those times?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.56,0:06:30.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, all three groups came here while Ai{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r} was at school.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.55,0:06:33.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Come to think of it...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.86,0:06:37.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There was someone who asked a lot of questions\Nsuch as Ai{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r}'s time of return, her friends...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.28,0:06:41.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And what we do on Saturdays and Sundays.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.16,0:06:44.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That must be the culprit right there!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.66,0:06:47.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So you don't remember who that person was?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.49,0:06:51.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, I'm surest was among those three groups, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.08,0:06:55.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Among those three groups, was there anyone who spoke of cats?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.09,0:06:58.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Especially about this Russian Blue.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.26,0:07:02.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Our conversations were almost all about the vase...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.97,0:07:04.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Russian Blue?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.30,0:07:08.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If I remember correctly, the cat Ran's\Nmother has is also a Russian Blue.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.61,0:07:12.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Speaking of vases and cats, they remind me of the vase cat videos!

Dialogue: 0,0:12:49.30,0:12:51.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the only reason they would've done that was...

Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.60,0:13:11.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then why?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.71,0:13:13.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Didn't the professor just mention it?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.87,0:13:18.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That although the back is a little dirty, it had\Nbeen returned without any stains on the front.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.75,0:13:25.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But during the time Ayumi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r} was wrapped in the rug, the coffee\Nthat soaked into her hood even got so far as to stain her ear, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.26,0:13:35.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They switched it.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:37.30,0:13:38.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.44,0:13:43.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The reason why they let Ayumi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r} out of the rug in the\Ndark for a while was so that she wouldn't notice the switch.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.69,0:13:50.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they probably had this rug that has a similar pattern\Nalready in that car, so that they could swap them quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.07,0:13:54.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, if that's the case, they didn't have to go and kidnap Ayumi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r}!
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.74,0:13:55.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.95,0:13:58.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why couldn't they just come and steal the rug?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:58.12,0:13:58.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see!
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.75,0:14:02.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If it had been stolen, we would've filed a theft report...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:02.75,0:14:05.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they wouldn't have been able to sell it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:05.00,0:14:05.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:05.96,0:14:10.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since the pattern of that rug is recorded\Nplain as day in the professor's video.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.55,0:14:15.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,However, I don't believe there are such nefarious\Ncharacters within my acquaintances...

Dialogue: 0,0:14:24.86,0:14:29.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The sisters who lifted the vase, knocked\Non it, and looked at it for some time...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.95,0:14:34.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the couple who used a magnifying glass and\Nthoroughly examined the vase without touching it...

Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.14,0:14:43.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the father and son who came last were suspicious?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.73,0:14:48.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I bet they knew the value of the rug, and\Nwere trying to knock the price down further!
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.59,0:14:50.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, it's the opposite.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.37,0:14:53.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's because the Professor quoted too\Nlow of a price that they laughed.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.37,0:14:57.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprits wanted it so much that they'd even kidnap a child...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.89,0:15:00.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Means that the professor's rug is probably a Persian rug.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.02,0:15:06.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No two have the same design, and depending on the\Nrug it could even easily sell for over ten million yen.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.40,0:15:08.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ten million yen!?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.90,0:15:15.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's true that looking at the inside and outside of a vase\Nto ascertain its age is also a method of appraisal.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.12,0:15:20.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the father and son were such connoisseurs that they could tell the\Nvase's value just by briefly touching it and peeking at the inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.56,0:15:25.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They likely immediately realized that the rug\Nwas a Persian, but they're not the culprits.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.04,0:15:27.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:27.90,0:15:31.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they would go so far as to commit this sort of\Ncrime in order to get their hands on the rug...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.80,0:15:34.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's no way they wouldn't have taken the 500,000 yen offer.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.84,0:15:37.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, the sisters who came first are the culprits?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.60,0:15:41.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why not the couple who were the second to come?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:41.52,0:15:42.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course not them!
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.77,0:15:48.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since that couple kindly advised me that it may be something\Nreally valuable, so I'd better have an appraiser look at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.61,0:15:51.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wasn't that about the vase though?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:51.94,0:15:58.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And to be accurate, they suggested you to "take it to a\Nprofessional appraiser and have them take a look," right?

Dialogue: 0,0:16:00.08,0:16:01.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.29,0:16:07.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We could infer their meaning to be, "It'd be bad if anyone else\Nrealized it was a Persian rug, so don't invite anyone else here!"
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.26,0:16:12.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Plus, in contrast to the sisters who picked\Nup the vase and gazed for a while...

Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.93,0:16:18.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:19.18,0:16:24.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was natural for the sisters who only focused on the\Nvase to do what they did, but not so for that couple.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:31.23,0:16:33.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What that couple was examining was...
