Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.02,0:05:44.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only that much.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.35,0:05:47.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Here you go.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.65,0:05:50.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I had my assistant bring this gasoline.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.92,0:06:12.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Geez, you've got awful manners!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.71,0:06:16.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I already told you, the week before last\Ntheir fight was about cars and clothes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.63,0:06:19.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm asking why they fought over something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.18,0:06:21.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.93,0:06:28.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe it was because Ena-chan told Sudou to drive\Nhere in his classic car, but he came in his new car.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.27,0:06:33.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Later it was because Sudou didn't come wearing\Nthe clothes Ena bought him for the party.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.74,0:06:35.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What kind of clothes?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.61,0:06:37.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What kind?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.95,0:06:48.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As for the sweater, Ena gave it to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.25,0:06:52.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As for fleece, Sudou has liked it ever since he\Nstarted the company and has worn it often, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.96,0:06:55.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He didn't much like wool.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.88,0:06:59.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But he came wearing a wool sweater last week, didn't he?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.59,0:07:01.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He even drove that classic car, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.51,0:07:07.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And yet, when Ena saw Sudou kun holding a\Nplastic bottle of mineral water, she got really angry.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.69,0:07:08.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.90,0:07:13.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She said, "You were loitering at some gasoline stand\Non the way even though everyone was waiting."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.40,0:07:17.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sudou irritably replied, "No one tells me where to go."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.36,0:07:22.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, Ena spilled the wine she was holding on Sudou-kun's sweater.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.33,0:07:26.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ena started to cry and said, "I'm sorry!\NI'll buy you a new one. I'm sorry."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.62,0:07:30.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The party last week was ruined as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.42,0:07:32.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, that's strange...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.67,0:07:37.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ena said before that she hates classic cars.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.55,0:07:40.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Classic car...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.68,0:07:42.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wool sweater...

Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.50,0:08:10.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So we couldn't enjoy it, could we?
