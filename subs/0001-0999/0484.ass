Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.96,0:06:56.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, and I heard he really hated to be photographed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.92,0:06:58.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So I have no idea what he looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.18,0:07:02.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,One more thing, every time his name came up, it was different.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.35,0:07:08.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Like Tsubouchi or Ishikawa. Hondou was just one of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.52,0:07:13.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see. So being uncommunicative\Nwas part of him being extremely cautious.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.31,0:07:19.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. So, if that grandson has met Hondou's father, it could be...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.24,0:07:22.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The grandson could be under surveillance.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.37,0:07:26.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What? You don't need dinner?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.73,0:07:50.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Still, is this safe?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.31,0:07:54.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's fine. I told Ran I was staying here tonight over the phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.94,0:07:59.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's not what I meant. That person is\Nconnected with those black-clothed guys.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.78,0:08:03.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why we have to hurry. If we wait,\Nshe might hear what we're talking about.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.91,0:08:06.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And then she'll suggest coming with us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.41,0:08:07.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,'She'?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.54,0:08:09.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You know. She's in the bath now.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.04,0:08:19.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, yes, the thing is, your grandfather\Nasked me for a favor when he was alive.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.01,0:08:24.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was to give something to one of his\Nregular customers that he got along well with.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.72,0:08:31.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I have a pretty good idea who that\Nperson is, but I just want to confirm it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.98,0:08:34.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's a really valuable object you see.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.90,0:08:39.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, maybe you mean that customer\Nwho came in all the time with his son.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.53,0:08:42.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, th-that might be the one.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.95,0:08:46.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you know that person's name or where he worked or anything?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.45,0:08:49.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, I only met him two or three times.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.58,0:08:55.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did he have any unique characteristics?\NBecause I have two or three people in mind.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.22,0:15:27.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You see? That person must have sweat a lot\Nin this stuffy room during the heat of the day.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:27.77,0:15:29.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They wiped it off and discarded it into the wastebasket.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.19,0:15:37.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the sweat that fell probably came from when\Nthey stopped to look around the bookcase and the desk.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.99,0:15:50.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And I always leave the remote\Ncontrol for the air conditioner on the desk.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:50.83,0:15:52.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It would have been easy to notice.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.17,0:15:56.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, they didn't dare to use the air conditioner.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:56.71,0:16:01.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because if you came back and found the room\Nwas pleasantly cool, I think you'd be suspicious.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.22,0:16:09.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And how long would it take for the cold room to return to\Nnormal temperature once they turned off the air conditioner?

Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.14,0:16:17.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the conclusive evidence is the\Nsmall amount of heat this computer retained.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.16,0:16:30.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I think it was probably the photograph.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.75,0:16:38.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The photo that might show the person we are looking for.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.80,0:17:25.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Incidentally, the reason I said the\Nperson was here just a few minutes ago was...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.93,0:17:29.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In this hot and stuffy room, neither the droplets of sweat on the floor,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.72,0:17:33.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nor the tissues used to wipe it off have dried yet.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.48,0:17:37.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,From the surface area of the droplets and\Nthe temperature and humidity of the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.06,0:17:41.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And since in this closed-up room, there was no air flowing,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:41.86,0:17:43.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even the smell of the leftover food has been trapped, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:44.65,0:17:49.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, guessing from the amount the sweat droplets have dried,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.28,0:17:53.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'd say someone was here less than 10 minutes ago.
