Dialogue: 0,0:18:14.89,0:18:16.69,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}Judging from the situation,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:16.69,0:18:19.48,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}it seems that he slit his own throat
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.48,0:18:21.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}after those three went out between 6 and 7 PM.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.58,0:18:37.42,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}but there's no blood on it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.42,0:18:42.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}True, but when they broke into the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.01,0:18:45.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}someone could've kicked the key accidentally.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.01,0:18:46.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}So it ended up there.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:58.12,0:19:00.15,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}and wanted to take away his body.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.15,0:19:03.95,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}But those three broke the door so loudly, that when they came in,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.36,0:19:09.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}the grim reaper was surprised and dropped the key onto the dry blood.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.53,0:19:19.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}So why was it warm?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.21,0:19:24.05,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}That's probably because someone hid the key in their palms,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.05,0:19:27.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}and threw it near the body when they entered the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.30,0:19:31.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,{\be2}to make it look like the room was sealed.
