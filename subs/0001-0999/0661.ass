Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.58,0:18:37.42,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,but there's no blood on it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.42,0:18:42.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,True, but when they broke into the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.01,0:18:45.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,someone could've kicked the key accidentally.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.01,0:18:46.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So it ended up there.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:46.55,0:18:49.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But, when I came into the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.90,0:18:51.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I touched the key a little.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.55,0:18:54.75,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.89,0:18:58.11,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure the grim reaper took his life,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:58.12,0:19:00.15,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and wanted to take away his body.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.15,0:19:03.95,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But those three broke the door so loudly, that when they came in,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.36,0:19:09.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,the grim reaper was surprised and dropped the key onto the dry blood.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:11.20,0:19:14.49,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Oh, but that's weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.50,0:19:17.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,A grim reaper's hands should be cold.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.53,0:19:19.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So why was it warm?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.21,0:19:24.05,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's probably because someone hid the key in their palms,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.05,0:19:27.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and threw it near the body when they entered the room,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.30,0:19:31.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,to make it look like the room was sealed.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:46.78,0:19:52.29,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then what was the loud TV sound the three of us heard before setting off?!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:52.29,0:19:55.79,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm certain it was coming from this room!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.79,0:19:59.13,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Someone probably recorded the TV sound ahead of time
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.13,0:20:00.63,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and used a timer to play it.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.63,0:20:04.09,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But the first thing we heard were the 6 PM news,

Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.22,0:20:14.89,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe he used a DVD or TV recorder.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:14.89,0:20:20.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Nowadays, TVs can turn on automatically if you schedule a time for a programme you want to watch.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:20.02,0:20:23.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And using several extra devices you can make it look like it's zapping through channels.
