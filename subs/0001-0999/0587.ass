Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.25,0:05:29.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The one I protected was...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.76,0:05:33.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That black pedestal.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.01,0:05:37.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And I was in charge of the green one.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.64,0:05:43.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And finally, I had this red pedestal.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.19,0:05:47.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But weren't you scared?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.23,0:05:51.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because even if there was a blackout, electricity\Nwas still running through the pedestals.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.65,0:05:52.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's why...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.99,0:05:54.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, old man!

Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.79,0:06:03.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.75,0:06:06.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But as far as under the floor, the ceiling, and the four corners go...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.92,0:06:11.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I didn't touch them since there were already\Ncomplicated mechanisms installed.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.01,0:06:19.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Uhm...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.56,0:06:25.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you're saying Kid has accomplices among\Nus, I know someone that's suspicious.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.89,0:06:28.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's the guy in charge of the audio.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.06,0:06:33.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Although it was supposed to be a young staff member...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.03,0:06:35.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He suddenly got replaced for no reason.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.24,0:06:40.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I told you, that's because they couldn't get in touch with that guy.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.41,0:06:43.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you're going this far, then you're suspicious too, cameraman!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.91,0:06:50.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The person who's really in charge of the camera for\Nthis program was a junior of mine from college.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.08,0:06:52.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But a pro like you somehow took over!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.13,0:06:53.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What're you saying!?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.92,0:07:00.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He's the one who called and asked me to substitute for him, saying\Nhe lacked the confidence to do a live broadcast fresh out of college!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.89,0:07:02.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's what I heard too.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.26,0:07:09.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since Advisor Suzuki was all fired up and even\Npurposely prepared matching parkas for the kids...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.48,0:07:10.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why they replaced him with a pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.23,0:07:12.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"Purposely," you say?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.82,0:07:17.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I had those made only because your TV station\Ntold me it'd be more thrilling that way!

Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.08,0:07:32.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you also call us Detective Boys here\Nbecause someone else told you to?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.25,0:07:37.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, it was written in the postscript of that guy's advance notice.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.34,0:07:43.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"This time, let us cease the child's play and\Nengage in battles as adults," it said.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.43,0:07:51.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's how I realized that guy was weak against children,\Nand the reason why I called in the Detective Boys.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.15,0:07:57.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's true that if the calls reaching the\NTV station staff were all Kid's doing...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.11,0:08:01.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It would mean he was purposely trying to exclude young people here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.99,0:08:07.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If so, I wonder why he wrote that on\Nthe postscript of his advance notice?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.54,0:08:10.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Judging from the advisor's character...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.83,0:08:15.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Isn't it easy to predict that he'd call us, the\Nextremely young Detective Boys, here?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.42,0:08:19.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And besides, this case is full of mysteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.93,0:08:24.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's baffling that the stolen jewel hasn't been found anywhere.
