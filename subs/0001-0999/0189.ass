Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.41,0:05:51.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"To", dragon and egg represent the 12 years' symbols!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.12,0:05:54.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"Dragon" is the year of the dragon, "egg" is the year of the snake.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.72,0:05:56.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then what's the "To"?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.79,0:05:59.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's probably the tiger or rooster.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.43,0:06:08.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the year, or path, of the dragon is right next to the egg!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.77,0:06:13.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But those bad guys just said the first path is a dead end.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.77,0:06:17.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Also, I think the egg would relate more to the year of the rooster.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.61,0:06:22.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes, but then it would overlap with the meaning of the character "To".
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.71,0:06:27.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wait, Maybe the egg represents the year of the rabbit!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.82,0:06:30.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The kanji for "rabbit" is very similar to the kanji for "egg".
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:32.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But only birds lay eggs!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.33,0:06:41.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"To", dragon and egg don't seem to relate to the 12 years' symbols.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.67,0:06:47.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The only connection between them is that they all have only one Japanese kanji character.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.12,0:07:03.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Come to think of it, egg can be written as "Tama no Ko".
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.12,0:07:06.29,Dialogue Top,,0,0,0,,(Tama = orb. ko = small. When put together, it means "small orb")
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.62,0:07:04.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.56,0:07:05.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,W-Wait a second!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.96,0:07:08.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This could possibly, just possibly be...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.88,0:07:27.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's an alternate name for pointing out the king.
