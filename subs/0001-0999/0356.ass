Dialogue: 0,0:39:50.97,0:39:55.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1.3}First off, you flew over the buildings in your assistant's helicopter.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.69,0:40:00.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1.3}From the helicopter, you hooked one end of a wire to the building's roof,

Dialogue: 0,0:40:30.68,0:40:37.85,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,{\blur1.3}{\fsp-1}After that, you removed the pulley and had the helicopter quickly retrieve the wire connecting the buildings.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:37.85,0:40:43.36,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,{\blur1.3}At that point, it looked like you were hanging from nothing, so your levitation trick was complete!

Dialogue: 0,0:41:13.30,0:41:18.98,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,{\blur1.3}But the Kid who appeared tonight was just a dummy with moving legs set up to distract the police.
