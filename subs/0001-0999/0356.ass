Dialogue: 0,0:40:57.00,0:41:02.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was an amazing performance to make people think you weren't hanging from anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:02.79,0:41:06.84,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,Then after walking for a bit, you cast off your white suit together with the smoke screen,

Dialogue: 0,0:41:08.30,0:41:13.30,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,and had your assistant pull you up into the helicopter to make it look like you vanished in mid-air.

Dialogue: 0,0:41:21.74,0:41:25.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it was just hanging there, so it was obvious.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:25.07,0:41:29.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But boy, didn't you climb up to the rooftop to watch Kid?
Dialogue: 0,0:41:29.07,0:41:33.99,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,If there was something hanging off a helicopter, you would've seen it, no matter how thin the wire was!

Dialogue: 0,0:41:39.62,0:41:45.34,Dialogue,,1,1,0,,I was completely convinced you weren't suspended\Nby a wire, because I'd seen a helicopter fly over you.

Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.73,0:42:12.57,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,It depends on the video's resolution, but either way it's very hard to see such a thin wire on a monitor.
