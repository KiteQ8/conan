Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.30,0:03:49.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Heath's height was 6 feet and 3 inches, about 1.90 metres.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.25,0:03:53.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,About the same height as you, when you put that pamphlet over your head.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.61,0:03:57.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And when I measured you, the pamphlet was visible over the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.62,0:04:03.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, Heath's head would've stuck out, since couldn't crouch with those wings,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.19,0:04:06.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,which means he couldn't fit behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.71,0:04:11.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why the killer made use of something in the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.26,0:04:17.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The actors use it to appear and disappear from the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.93,0:04:19.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A trap door.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.44,0:04:26.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But there was no trap door behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.47,0:04:30.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only thing that was there was a weird iron thing on the floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.94,0:04:32.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Moron.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.36,0:04:35.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If there's an iron door, then there's gotta be a hole under it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.95,0:04:40.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,One of the feathers from Heath's wings was caught in it,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.95,0:04:45.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,causing his blood to make two semi-circles below it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.46,0:04:48.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And taking into account the donut-shaped floor
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.96,0:04:54.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the twisted curtains, there's only one possible solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.70,0:04:59.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All you have to do is shift the donut-shaped floor...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.97,0:05:04.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the hole will appear.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.20,0:05:11.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure that if they check it,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.61,0:05:18.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,they'll find more feathers, blood from Heath,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.12,0:05:22.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the bullet casing from the gun.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.27,0:05:27.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You mean he was shot at close range?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.46,0:05:33.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Heath was waiting in the hole for his scene,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.02,0:05:35.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so the killer waited for him to come up and shot him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.35,0:05:39.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The door was set against the back of the mirror,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.09,0:05:41.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so she just had to put the gun below the mirror and through the grid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.93,0:05:44.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then the killer's...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.43,0:05:47.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right. Only one person could do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.64,0:05:50.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The one lying down next to the mirror...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.69,0:05:53.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose, it was you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.55,0:05:57.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose!?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.85,0:06:00.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No way... it can't be!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.24,0:06:04.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,None of us were told that the trap door was going to be used!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.29,0:06:08.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That can be explained. It's because...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.17,0:06:12.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They didn't tell you because they couldn't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.17,0:06:17.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That the mirror that everyone saw as their guardian angel, was broken...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.76,0:06:22.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose must have damaged it in secret.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.14,0:06:27.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the staff saw it was damaged,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.14,0:06:32.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,they cut off the damaged part and glued it back together,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.65,0:06:35.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so the actors wouldn't notice the damage.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.63,0:06:40.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But due to the shorter frame, Heath's head stuck out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.65,0:06:46.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they'd put it on a platform, the actors would've noticed something's wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.70,0:06:53.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why they decided to use the trap door and hide Heath's body.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.14,0:06:58.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And that's why they hid it from all but Heath and Rose.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.80,0:07:02.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why would the staff tell Rose?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.14,0:07:09.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They had to. Moving the donut-shaped floor would hide the hole, but not the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.81,0:07:17.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Unless Rose closed the door from below the mirror, the audience would've seen the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.32,0:07:19.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then what about the gun?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.69,0:07:22.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The gun fell from above, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.21,0:07:26.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She couldn't have done that if she was lying down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.74,0:07:28.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It can be done.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.55,0:07:32.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you consider that the angel, Heath, was going to be suspended.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.75,0:07:36.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Remember how Heath had a burn mark on his chest?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.75,0:07:42.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's because Rose put the gun in his suit right after firing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.62,0:07:49.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Riding on his clothes, it would've fallen off from the recoil when he stopped being raised.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.77,0:07:55.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What she didn't count on, was for him to grab her hand while doing so.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.53,0:08:01.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The blood on his hand being smudged proves it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.78,0:08:08.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So it should still be there... On her right arm, inside her right glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.54,0:08:12.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Heath's resentful, bloody handprint.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.35,0:08:20.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She likely put her gloves on inside out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.71,0:08:26.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And after shooting him, she put them back.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.93,0:08:31.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way, she'd be able to pass a GSR test.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.85,0:08:37.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But Shin'ichi, how did you know there was blood under the glove?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.02,0:08:39.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because in the dressing room,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.04,0:08:44.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,she was going through a lot of effort to open the can of juice with the gloves on.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.03,0:08:47.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All she'd have to do would be take off her glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.53,0:08:52.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But she didn't, which told me she was hiding something.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.04,0:08:57.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, that's when I found out her motive for killing Heath, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.50,0:08:59.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Motive?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.17,0:09:02.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Lila and Akane had pictures on their mirrors, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.61,0:09:05.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were alone with Heath on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.23,0:09:07.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But in Rose's pictures...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.30,0:09:09.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.98,0:09:13.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just pictures of Heath dressed as an angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.81,0:09:17.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She wasn't actually in love with him,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.10,0:09:19.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but with his role as an angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.96,0:09:26.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. That's why I sealed his life while he was Michael.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.07,0:09:29.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't stand the idea of another man playing him.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.57,0:09:32.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't allow it!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.08,0:09:38.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But he was only leaving the role because he got a part in a movie...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.19,0:09:40.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it was his choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.19,0:09:43.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He killed Michael.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.55,0:09:49.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When I told him I loved the angel he was playing!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.90,0:09:56.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But I was blessed by God, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.06,0:10:03.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since He saved me when my dress got caught on a nail and the armor fell.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.34,0:10:07.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Thank you, sweet angel...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.59,0:10:09.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You helped me do it...
