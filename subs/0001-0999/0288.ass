Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.10,0:03:49.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Heath's height was 6 feet and 3 inches, about 1.90 meters.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.05,0:03:53.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,About the same height as you, when you put that pamphlet over your head.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.41,0:03:57.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And when I measured you, the pamphlet was visible over the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.42,0:04:02.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, Heath's head would've stuck out, since couldn't crouch with those wings,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.99,0:04:06.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,which means he couldn't fit behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.51,0:04:11.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why the killer made use of something in the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.06,0:04:17.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The actors use it to appear and disappear from the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.73,0:04:19.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A trap door.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.24,0:04:26.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But there was no trap door behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.27,0:04:30.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only thing that was there was a weird iron thing on the floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.74,0:04:32.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Moron.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.16,0:04:35.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If there's an iron door, then there's gotta be a hole under it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.75,0:04:40.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,One of the feathers from Heath's wings was caught in it,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.75,0:04:45.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,causing his blood to make two semi-circles below it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.26,0:04:48.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And taking into account the donut-shaped floor
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.76,0:04:53.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the twisted curtains, there's only one possible solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.50,0:04:59.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All you have to do is shift the donut-shaped floor...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.77,0:05:03.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the hole will appear.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:11.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure that if they check it,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.41,0:05:17.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,they'll find more feathers, blood from Heath,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.92,0:05:22.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and the bullet casing from the gun.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.07,0:05:27.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You mean he was shot at close range?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.26,0:05:32.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Heath was waiting in the hole for his scene,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.82,0:05:35.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so the killer waited for him to come up and shot him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.15,0:05:38.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The door was set against the back of the mirror,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.89,0:05:41.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so she just had to put the gun below the mirror and through the grid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.73,0:05:44.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then the killer's...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.23,0:05:47.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right. Only one person could do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.44,0:05:50.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The one lying down next to the mirror...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.49,0:05:53.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose, it was you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.35,0:05:57.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose!?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.65,0:06:00.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No way... it can't be!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.04,0:06:04.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,None of us were told that the trap door was going to be used!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.09,0:06:07.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That can be explained. It's because...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.97,0:06:11.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They didn't tell you because they couldn't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.97,0:06:17.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That the mirror that everyone saw as their guardian angel, was broken...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.56,0:06:21.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Rose must have damaged it in secret.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.94,0:06:26.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the staff saw it was damaged,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.94,0:06:32.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,they cut off the damaged part and glued it back together,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.45,0:06:35.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so the actors wouldn't notice the damage.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.43,0:06:40.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But due to the shorter frame, Heath's head stuck out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.45,0:06:46.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they'd put it on a platform, the actors would've noticed something's wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.50,0:06:53.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why they decided to use the trap door and hide Heath's body.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.94,0:06:57.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And that's why they hid it from all but Heath and Rose.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.60,0:07:01.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why would the staff tell Rose?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.94,0:07:09.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They had to. Moving the donut-shaped floor would hide the hole, but not the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.61,0:07:17.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Unless Rose closed the door from below the mirror, the audience would've seen the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.12,0:07:19.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then what about the gun?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.49,0:07:22.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The gun fell from above, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.01,0:07:26.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She couldn't have done that if she was lying down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.54,0:07:28.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It can be done.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.35,0:07:32.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you consider that the angel, Heath, was going to be suspended.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.55,0:07:36.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Remember how Heath had a burn mark on his chest?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.55,0:07:42.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's because Rose put the gun in his suit right after firing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.42,0:07:49.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Riding on his clothes, it would've fallen off from the recoil when he stopped being raised.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.57,0:07:55.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What she didn't count on, was for him to grab her hand while doing so.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.33,0:08:01.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The blood on his hand being smudged proves it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.58,0:08:08.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So it should still be there... On her right arm, inside her right glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.34,0:08:12.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Heath's resentful, bloody handprint.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.15,0:08:20.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She likely put her gloves on inside out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.51,0:08:25.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And after shooting him, she put them back.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.73,0:08:31.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way, she'd be able to pass a GSR test.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.65,0:08:36.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But Shin'ichi, how did you know there was blood under the glove?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.82,0:08:38.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because in the dressing room,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.84,0:08:43.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,she was going through a lot of effort to open the can of juice with the gloves on.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.83,0:08:47.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All she'd have to do would be take off her glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.33,0:08:51.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But she didn't, which told me she was hiding something.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.84,0:08:57.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, that's when I found out her motive for killing Heath, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.30,0:08:58.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Motive?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.97,0:09:02.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Lila and Akane had pictures on their mirrors, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.41,0:09:05.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were alone with Heath on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.03,0:09:07.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But in Rose's pictures...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.10,0:09:09.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.78,0:09:13.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just pictures of Heath dressed as an angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.61,0:09:16.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She wasn't actually in love with him,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.90,0:09:19.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but with his role as an angel.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.76,0:09:25.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. That's why I sealed his life while he was Michael.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.87,0:09:29.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't stand the idea of another man playing him.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.37,0:09:32.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't allow it!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.88,0:09:37.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But he was only leaving the role because he got a part in a movie...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.99,0:09:39.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it was his choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.99,0:09:43.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He killed Michael.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.35,0:09:49.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When I told him I loved the angel he was playing!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.70,0:09:55.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But I was blessed by God, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.86,0:10:02.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since He saved me when my dress got caught on a nail and the armor fell.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.14,0:10:06.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Thank you, sweet angel...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.39,0:10:09.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You helped me do it...
