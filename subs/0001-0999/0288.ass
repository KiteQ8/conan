Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.04,0:03:58.49,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't you think it's strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.49,0:04:02.63,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Heath's height was 6 feet and 3 inches, about 1.90 metres.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.44,0:04:06.80,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,About the same height as you, when you put that pamphlet over your head.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.80,0:04:10.81,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And when I measured you, the pamphlet was visible over the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.81,0:04:16.38,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Furthermore, Heath's head would've stuck out, since couldn't crouch with those wings,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.38,0:04:19.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,which means he couldn't fit behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.90,0:04:24.45,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why the killer made use of something in the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.45,0:04:31.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The actors use it to appear and disappear from the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.12,0:04:32.72,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,A trap door.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.63,0:04:39.66,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But there was no trap door behind the mirror.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.66,0:04:44.13,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Only thing that was there was a weird iron thing on the floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.13,0:04:45.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Moron.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.55,0:04:49.14,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If there's an iron door, then there's gotta be a hole under it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.14,0:04:54.14,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,One of the feathers from Heath's wings was caught in it,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.14,0:04:58.65,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,causing his blood to make two semi-circles below it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.65,0:05:02.15,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And taking into account the donut-shaped floor
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.15,0:05:07.32,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and the twisted curtains, there's only one possible solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.89,0:05:13.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,All you have to do is shift the donut-shaped floor...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.16,0:05:17.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and the hole will appear.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.39,0:05:24.80,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure that if they check it,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.80,0:05:31.31,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,they'll find more feathers, blood from Heath,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.31,0:05:35.48,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and the bullet casing from the gun.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.46,0:05:40.65,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You mean he was shot at close range?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.65,0:05:46.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah. Heath was waiting in the hole for his scene,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.21,0:05:48.54,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,so the killer waited for him to come up and shot him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.54,0:05:52.28,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The door was set against the back of the mirror,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.28,0:05:55.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,so she just had to put the gun below the mirror and through the grid.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.12,0:05:57.62,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then the killer's...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.62,0:06:00.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Right. Only one person could do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.83,0:06:03.88,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The one lying down next to the mirror...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.88,0:06:06.54,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Rose, it was you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.74,0:06:11.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Rose!?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.04,0:06:13.43,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No way... it can't be!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.43,0:06:17.48,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,None of us were told that the trap door was going to be used!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.48,0:06:21.36,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That can be explained. It's because...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.36,0:06:25.36,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,They didn't tell you because they couldn't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.36,0:06:30.95,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That the mirror that everyone saw as their guardian angel, was broken...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.95,0:06:35.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Rose must have damaged it in secret.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.33,0:06:40.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,When the staff saw it was damaged,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.33,0:06:45.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,they cut off the damaged part and glued it back together,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:49.17,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,so the actors wouldn't notice the damage.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.82,0:06:53.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But due to the shorter frame, Heath's head stuck out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.84,0:06:59.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If they'd put it on a platform, the actors would've noticed something's wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.89,0:07:06.60,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's why they decided to use the trap door and hide Heath's body.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.33,0:07:11.28,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And that's why they hid it from all but Heath and Rose.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.99,0:07:15.33,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But why would the staff tell Rose?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.33,0:07:23.00,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,They had to. Moving the donut-shaped floor would hide the hole, but not the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.00,0:07:30.51,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Unless Rose closed the door from below the mirror, the audience would've seen the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.51,0:07:32.88,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then what about the gun?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.88,0:07:35.64,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The gun fell from above, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.40,0:07:39.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,She couldn't have done that if she was lying down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.93,0:07:41.74,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It can be done.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.74,0:07:45.94,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If you consider that the angel, Heath, was going to be suspended.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.94,0:07:49.94,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Remember how Heath had a burn mark on his chest?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.94,0:07:55.95,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's because Rose put the gun in his suit right after firing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.81,0:08:02.96,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Riding on his clothes, it would've fallen off from the recoil when he stopped being raised.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.96,0:08:08.57,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,What she didn't count on, was for him to grab her hand while doing so.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.72,0:08:15.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The blood on his hand being smudged proves it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.97,0:08:21.73,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So it should still be there... On her right arm, inside her right glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.73,0:08:25.56,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Heath's resentful, bloody handprint.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.54,0:08:33.90,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,She likely put her gloves on inside out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.90,0:08:39.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,And after shooting him, she put them back.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.12,0:08:45.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That way, she'd be able to pass a GSR test.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.04,0:08:50.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But Shin'ichi, how did you know there was blood under the glove?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.21,0:08:52.23,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Because in the dressing room,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.23,0:08:57.22,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,she was going through a lot of effort to open the can of juice with the gloves on.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.22,0:09:00.72,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,All she'd have to do would be take off her glove.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.72,0:09:05.23,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But she didn't, which told me she was hiding something.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.23,0:09:10.69,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, that's when I found out her motive for killing Heath, too.
