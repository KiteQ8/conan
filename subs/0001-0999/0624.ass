Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.48,0:03:28.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why do we have to be the ones to look for that video?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.46,0:03:32.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If it's in the storage area of the AV room, couldn't you just look for it yourself?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.96,0:03:48.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.17,0:03:53.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because, there's a ridiculous number of videotapes in the storage area!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.88,0:03:59.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The words on the labels are fading, and there also are a lot of videos with labels stacked on top of each other...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.46,0:04:00.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't know which is which!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.60,0:04:07.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, she plans to use you to find it since you seem to be skilled in such searches.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.38,0:04:09.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Figures...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.35,0:04:15.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So many tapes...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.01,0:04:19.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just like Sensei said, the words are fading...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.74,0:04:21.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And some of them have labels stacked on top of each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.55,0:04:25.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They're not sorted according to school year either...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.30,0:04:27.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's going to be tough to search.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.30,0:04:28.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let's just give it up!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.37,0:04:32.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We detective Boys are very cautious anyway...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.94,0:04:35.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So we don't need to watch anything like a crime prevention video!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.02,0:04:37.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You can never be too careful.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.54,0:04:40.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since no matter how cautious you are...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.70,0:04:44.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There could be a case that a man of unknown character who is after your life...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.55,0:04:47.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,May be stealthily lurking next door!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.57,0:04:49.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Are you talking about Subaru{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.10,0:04:53.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he bothers you so much, why not just stay over at the detective agency?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.00,0:04:55.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\i1}No way.{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.69,0:04:58.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Anyway, how are we going to find the video?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.50,0:05:05.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If we play all of them and check their contents, we might find it eventually, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.62,0:05:07.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All of them!?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.42,0:05:09.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's no need for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.25,0:05:11.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since we were asked to help...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.54,0:05:16.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means Sensei already came and checked the shelves but still couldn't find it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.13,0:05:20.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if the words on the labels are fading, you can still read some of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.01,0:05:27.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And it's hard to imagine that such an important educational video would be taped over with a new label stuck on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.25,0:05:29.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, why couldn't she find it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.51,0:05:34.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In short, that videotape wasn't one the VHS tapes on the shelf.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.52,0:05:35.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Instead it was put away somewhere...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.50,0:05:40.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Meaning there's high probability that it was a Beta videotape!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.49,0:05:43.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,See, here it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.65,0:05:44.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The crime prevention video.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.62,0:05:47.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The video for the choir competition is here too!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.58,0:05:49.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.82,0:05:54.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So Kobayashi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-sensei{\r}'s homeroom teacher was a fan of Beta videos.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.76,0:05:56.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What on earth is "Beta"?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.84,0:06:00.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A long time ago, there were both Beta and VHS tapes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.34,0:06:03.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But Beta ended up losing out and faded away, or so I heard.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.89,0:06:06.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why did Beta lose out?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.60,0:06:07.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Dunno...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.51,0:06:09.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe its performance wasn't good.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.22,0:06:10.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's not the case!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.39,0:06:15.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At the time, Beta was better than VHS in both picture quality and sound...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.57,0:06:19.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the size of the cassette was smaller, so it was very popular among enthusiasts!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.22,0:06:21.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Detective Chiba...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.61,0:06:25.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, it was inferior in regards to recording length...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.27,0:06:27.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So its sales strategy failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.91,0:06:30.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What are you doing in a place like this?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.73,0:06:36.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I came to pass out the crime prevention flyers, and took the chance to wander around the building...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.74,0:06:40.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since I was a graduate of this school, I felt nostalgic.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.84,0:06:44.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But that doesn't explain why you were hiding in the AV room, does it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.07,0:06:46.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.76,0:06:47.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Actually...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.97,0:06:53.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You were looking for a reply to a love letter from 13 years ago?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.50,0:06:55.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.22,0:06:55.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.20,0:06:57.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I was on the broadcasting team.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.44,0:07:03.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,One time our team recorded and broadcast a mini-drama during lunch break, and became an instant hit.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.11,0:07:11.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having nothing to lose, I suggested our team record a live action special effects drama and show it in the school arts festival.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.16,0:07:16.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What happened next was a girl teammate in the same grade as myself became enthusiastic about it...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.08,0:07:21.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Other team members got on board because of her, and we completed the SFX drama.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.33,0:07:27.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Thinking that girl was truly a fan of SFX like me, I dropped all sorts of hardcore fan jargon...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.59,0:07:29.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it completely bored her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.64,0:07:32.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When I asked her, "Do you really like special effects?"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.52,0:07:37.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's not special effects that I like...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.13,0:07:41.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't make me spell it out for you, dummy!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.50,0:07:44.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She said that with her face all red.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.52,0:07:48.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't help but to send her a love letter the next day.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.70,0:07:50.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I... guess I misunderstood after all, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.43,0:07:53.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, that was a nice read!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.66,0:07:55.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You were right on mark!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.32,0:07:57.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That girl liked you too, Detective Chiba!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.85,0:07:59.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.90,0:08:00.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.97,0:08:05.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why would the reply to that love letter be in this AV room's storage area?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.80,0:08:08.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you get the reply but lose it here?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.59,0:08:10.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No...
