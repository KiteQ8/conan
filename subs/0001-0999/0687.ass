Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.44,0:17:33.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}These are the weights the killer used.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.44,0:17:37.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}T-This is glass, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:39.91,0:17:45.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Something like this would be undistinguishable from ice,\Nso it could be left in place without looking conspicuous.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:52.67,0:17:55.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Of course. That's because the ice has frozen back in place again.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:55.67,0:17:58.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}But that means the trick can't be completed!
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.22,0:18:02.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}That's why the killer had to use this.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.97,0:18:06.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I see! By setting the string on fire it could be burnt away.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:10.56,0:18:15.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}But would the part that's inside the ice really burn up so easily?

Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.50,0:18:31.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Magnesium is highly flammable, so even if it's inside ice it'll keep burning.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:46.60,0:18:52.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}As the magnesium burns, it creates a compound: magnesium oxide.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:08.75,0:19:14.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}To make sure this trick works, you'd have to know\Nexactly where the mayor was sleeping.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.94,0:19:43.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}The bed in the VIP dome was a perfect fit for the mayor.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.66,0:19:49.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I found it strange, how, despite the dome being really\Nspacious, the bed was actually quite small in comparison.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.08,0:19:54.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}That's because the bed was made to\Nperfectly match the mayor's short height.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.79,0:19:57.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Do you have any evidence to prove that?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.84,0:20:01.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}The proof is the white powder on Shiota-{\i1}san{\i0}'s sleeve.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.34,0:20:07.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}That's magnesium oxide, which caught on your sleeve when you burnt the murder weapon, isn't it?
