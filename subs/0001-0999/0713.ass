Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.90,0:04:31.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was very kind. He even paid for my hospitalisation and surgery fees!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.27,0:04:36.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So he's the reason you work as a maid here?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.59,0:04:37.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.70,0:04:41.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm looking after the master who my mother was going to marry!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.30,0:04:47.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, what actually happened was that half a year ago, back when I was unemployed after graduating from university,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.33,0:04:52.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I got an invitation from the master saying 'there's an opening as a maid, so won't you come?'

Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.77,0:05:03.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This morning, even though the master called for me, I didn't know which room, so I ended up standing him up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.35,0:05:06.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So the master's going to be mad when we find him, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.66,0:05:11.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I-It's fine! He's never been mad at me since I came here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.92,0:05:15.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Though the others do complain about him being too strict at checking the cleaning.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.50,0:05:18.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It{\i1} is{\i0} a pretty shoddy job, you know.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.09,0:05:33.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When I told them there weren't any gyōza skins, they said they'd make some themselves
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.94,0:05:36.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and asked where the bread and wheat flours were...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.79,0:05:38.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They probably spilled some since they were in a rush.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.55,0:05:42.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,After all, they placed the cloth for the finished skins on their lap and bundled them into clingfilm.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.31,0:05:45.65,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}The first thing to come to mind with garlic were gyōza, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.04,0:05:48.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But what's this wide gap here?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.87,0:05:54.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,See, for about fifty centimetres, there isn't any flour!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.54,0:05:56.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As if something'd been dragged through here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.85,0:05:58.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Speaking of which...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.81,0:06:04.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I told those girls that there might still be a bag of garlic in the storeroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.18,0:06:11.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they'd dragged that bag here, then they'd probably still be here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.10,0:06:14.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I found the garlic, Ran{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r}!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.35,0:06:17.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wow, there's so much!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.08,0:06:18.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh no...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.49,0:06:22.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It already started sproutin' and growin' roots...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.04,0:06:23.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't worry!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.46,0:06:26.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It won't taste as good, but you can still eat it as long as you cut them off.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.11,0:06:30.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But are we going to be okay with just garlic?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.35,0:06:32.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I got this, so we're covered!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.47,0:06:34.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A-A cross?!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.79,0:06:38.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah! It's made from a silver knife and spoon so it's super effective!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.62,0:06:44.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But for this kind of thing to work, don't you have to be a devout Christian?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.19,0:06:47.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's fine! Ran{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r}, you celebrate Christmas, don't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.79,0:06:52.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We celebrate Christ's birthday every year, so it's gotta work!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.78,0:06:56.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I guess.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.93,0:07:04.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What?! Type AB? The blood found inside the casket the master was sleeping in really was type AB?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.33,0:07:05.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.79,0:07:12.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mouri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} put in a good word and had the Gunma prefecture police examine it, and there's no doubt it was type AB.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.25,0:07:18.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But according to the folks here at the mansion, the master's blood type...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.05,0:07:19.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's type A.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.35,0:07:24.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the master was younger, he suffered a serious injury.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.53,0:07:30.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I still remember that we were given the honour of him using our type A blood.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.60,0:07:32.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then whose blood was it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.94,0:07:40.18,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,I believe the only one with type AB blood associated with this mansion was the maid Shimizu{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}, who passed away half a year ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.53,0:07:41.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Say what?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.38,0:07:47.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why would the blood of someone who died half a year ago be in that casket?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.48,0:07:53.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't tell me brother-in-law kept her blood and was drinking it inside the casket!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.86,0:08:00.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Shouldn't that blood be examinated for stuff like DNA?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.87,0:08:04.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And? Is it still gonna take long for the tunnel to be fixed?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.00,0:08:08.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. We told them we'd like to be able to cross it before morning, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.31,0:08:11.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And if anything happens to my daughter before then, there'll be {\i1}hell{\i0} to pay, you hear me?!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.06,0:08:14.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's fine, don't worry.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.85,0:08:17.93,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}The girls are distracted makin' gyōza anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.34,0:08:20.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And what about the master?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.06,0:08:22.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Still haven't found him.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.37,0:08:36.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And? Where's he now?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.25,0:08:38.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure he's in the smoking room taking a puff.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.92,0:08:43.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think Hakuya-{\i1}niisan{\i0} left his mobile phone somewhere.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.47,0:16:49.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh, right, speaking of the casket. When that incident took place half a year ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.58,0:16:53.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,it seems the master asked the chef to wake him up.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.34,0:17:25.23,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,Which means that if you pull this here, take this portion out, and put the ends together again, the rug becomes smaller, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.74,0:17:32.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So basically, when we came in, the coffin was closer to the centre of the room, over—

Dialogue: 0,0:18:51.40,0:18:57.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The master said she came here crying, using her status as his former fiancée's daughter to beg him to hire her.
