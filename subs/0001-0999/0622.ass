Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.12,0:13:24.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's because it was combined with an event...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.50,0:13:30.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And since the buildings near that art museum were all abandoned, special permission was given.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.06,0:13:53.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, the handling of explosives and the legal regulations concerned with it are strict in Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.40,0:14:00.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since there are still buildings in use right next to this one, it would be impossible for such a place to bee imploded.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.80,0:14:06.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And one needs to cross-check and thoroughly examine the building's construction blueprints...

Dialogue: 0,0:14:09.81,0:14:13.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why it can't be done by using just a hammer without any machinery.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.15,0:14:16.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, who were those people just now?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.90,0:14:20.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They disguised as demolition workers and confined someone here...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.97,0:14:23.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Which means they're a couple of bad guys!

Dialogue: 0,0:15:56.26,0:16:02.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I suppose it's because that person has their hands and feet bound, and their mouth sealed with something.
