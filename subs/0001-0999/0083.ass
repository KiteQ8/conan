Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.39,0:18:27.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,knocked me out, and put the knife in my hands to put my prints on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.02,0:18:31.39,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Finally, he returned to his room during the commotion
Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.39,0:18:33.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and turned the phone off.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:33.83,0:18:38.53,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,He must have felt quite relieved that it was all over.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:38.53,0:18:40.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But he made one big oversight.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.84,0:18:44.61,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The coffee the nurse kindly brought him.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:44.61,0:18:49.95,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I assume you all know Dr. Shirai has a real sweet tooth?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.95,0:18:54.18,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,However, the coffee's sugar hadn't been used at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.18,0:19:00.29,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,This means Dr. Shirai hadn't drunk the coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.29,0:19:04.96,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Ridiculous. Even I take it without sugar sometimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.96,0:19:07.63,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I would hardly call that proof.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:07.63,0:19:11.00,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So, then you did drink it?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:11.00,0:19:14.57,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, but if you're going to say how there was no saliva on it,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.57,0:19:17.87,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,that might be because I gave it a quick rinse.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.87,0:19:20.21,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,There's something else missing.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.21,0:19:22.55,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Oh? What would that be?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.55,0:19:27.35,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Your fingerprints. There aren't any on the coffee cup.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.35,0:19:30.42,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That's because I rinsed it...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.42,0:19:37.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But the fingerprints of the nurse who brought it are on the handle.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.16,0:19:44.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you saying you washed off your fingerprints from on top of hers?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.83,0:19:46.27,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That'd be impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:46.27,0:19:52.84,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,In short, when you rinsed the coffee cup, you had gloves on.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:52.84,0:19:55.51,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The surgical gloves you had used during the murder...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.51,0:19:58.98,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Why was he wearing gloves before then?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.98,0:20:02.18,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,When he returned to his room after the murder,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.18,0:20:05.79,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,he probably still had the weapon he hit me with.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.79,0:20:09.23,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,He couldn't get his prints on it before he disposed of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:09.23,0:20:14.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,At any rate, once back in his room, he felt he had to down the coffee,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:14.30,0:20:18.03,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,or else his alibi of being in the room would seem suspect,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.03,0:20:24.91,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,so he hurriedly poured it out, with gloves still on, and rinsed the cup.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:24.91,0:20:28.01,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But only the inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:28.01,0:20:34.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,For that reason, only the nurse's fingerprints remained on the cup.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.12,0:20:37.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You said you drank the coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:37.12,0:20:44.69,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Are there any other reasons your fingerprints weren't on the handle?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:44.69,0:20:45.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,How ironic.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.83,0:20:50.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Leaving evidence because of the gloves I wore to leave no evidence...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:50.83,0:20:52.94,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,So you admit to it?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.94,0:20:55.67,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's all as Mouri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} said.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:55.67,0:20:58.11,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Why? What was your motive?!

Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.87,0:21:32.37,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did I ever pay out all that money to get into school?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:32.37,0:21:39.12,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,In other words, crime and dishonesty doesn't pay, Doctor.
