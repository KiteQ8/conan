Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.48,0:06:37.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ignoring the fact that the contents of\Nthe stolen bags were mixed up...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.32,0:06:40.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why was he carrying them all with him to begin with?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.95,0:06:44.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he was caught carrying them, they'd serve as proof\Nthat he wouldn't be able to talk his way out of.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.79,0:06:50.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And those three's reaction to Ran's declaration that she might\Nhave found the Rooster Man's button also bothers me.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.31,0:07:09.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because that man was running and sweating...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.98,0:07:13.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why he tried to hide it for fear of being noticed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.86,0:07:14.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wait.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.90,0:07:20.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if that person is the culprit, it wouldn't be\Npossible for him to be at all three Rooster Festivals.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.41,0:07:25.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In that case, there should be another\NRooster Man outside of that person, but...
