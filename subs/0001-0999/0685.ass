Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.32,0:05:55.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Which means that for around nine minutes, your flat was empty, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.62,0:06:02.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}We didn't get to my flat with the detective until after he checked the others.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.55,0:06:07.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Then, when you left your flat, did you notice anything that stuck in your mind?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.12,0:06:41.79,Dialogue,,10,10,0,,{\blur1}They have more than enough motive to have done it, so I guess we'll keep them in for questioning a bit longer.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.47,0:06:58.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So how did the experiment go?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.06,0:07:02.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Froth on beer lasts around six minutes,\Nsteam lasts eight minutes,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.79,0:07:05.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}and cigarette smoke just under nine minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.32,0:07:09.00,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\blur2}So it wasn't connected with the room temperature...?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.81,0:07:41.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}It's something I did a lot back when I was a broke student.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.62,0:07:45.02,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\blur2}I see, so that's it!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.02,0:07:47.36,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\blur2}So that person {\i1}was{\i0} the killer after all!

Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.37,0:13:03.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}That's because the bell rang without being stopped, and stopped naturally after enough time had elapsed.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:03.79,0:14:07.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}And didn't you already explain it?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:07.36,0:14:13.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}If I was the killer, and used the stairs to go up 23 floors to the president's flat, push him off
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.10,0:14:20.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}and then run down to the ground floor, my flat would've been empty for over ten minutes when you got there.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.76,0:14:54.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I found salt in the kitchen and sprinkled some in.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.99,0:14:58.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So if you pour salt in beer, froth appears?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.54,0:15:03.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}It seems anything granular that sinks into beer, like sugar or sand, would've worked too.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.02,0:15:08.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}The moment a granular substance is poured into beer, the surface area in contact with air increases,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.99,0:15:13.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}so carbon dioxide gathers more easily, and the beer frothes.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.55,0:15:19.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}So, look, if I pour salt into another glass where the froth has gone...

Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.15,0:15:33.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Well? Surprised?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.40,0:15:37.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}It's something I did a lot back when I was a broke student.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.61,0:15:42.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}He was a poor, broke university student,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.94,0:15:46.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}so he used to add salt so people wouldn't notice that he was drinking his beer slowly.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.60,0:16:10.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}But Ogino-{\i1}san{\i0}, when you entered your flat, didn't you knock down a bag by the entrance?

Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.41,0:16:22.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Which means that a certain {\i1}something{\i0} would be inside.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.84,0:16:29.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}I see. So he used that salt.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:31.91,0:16:36.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}As he put the tea that had fallen out of the bag from the impact back in.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.26,0:16:39.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}At that time, he surreptitiously took the purification salt,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.72,0:16:44.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}put it in his pocket, ripped the sachet open, and put some salt in his hand.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:52.76,0:16:56.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}Well, since that was a trick thought up on the spur of the moment,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.10,0:17:04.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}even if he managed to get rid of the sachet somewhere,\Nthere should still be some grains of salt left inside his pocket.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.21,0:17:16.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,{\blur1}and since the circumstances called for him to leave the president's flat as soon as possible,
