Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.71,0:04:29.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We had no idea Kanbara-san didn't plan to leave the atelier.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.55,0:04:36.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right after the blackout, the criminal who was hiding\Nin the ceiling jumped down and killed Kanbara-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.35,0:04:41.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, was anything different after Kanbara-san\Nwent in and after Oikawa-san came back out?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.85,0:04:44.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Like, did he have blood on his clothes then?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.94,0:04:48.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, there wasn't any blood on him then.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.23,0:04:52.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But still, couldn't his clothes have been turned inside out?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.94,0:04:53.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They definitely weren't.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.53,0:04:58.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Inspector Nakamori thought that at\Nfirst, so he checked out his clothes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.45,0:05:05.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Although there was blood on the outside of the jacket,\Nthere was none inside or on the inside of his undershirt.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.37,0:05:11.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But also, that blood got on him after he\Ncome in with the inspector and his men.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.42,0:05:15.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He found Kanbara-san by chance when he was feeling around.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.72,0:05:17.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That must be when he got the blood on him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.31,0:05:22.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But was it really by chance?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.64,0:05:24.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You came in with the inspector, didn't you, boy?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.60,0:05:31.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since he was in the dark, cutting Kanbara-san's throat\Nso quickly while we were looking for a light source...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.86,0:05:34.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That would be pretty much impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.45,0:05:45.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, now that you mention it, the door Oikawa-san\Nknocked on during the blackout was that one, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.12,0:05:49.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since Kanbara-san went in from this side,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.29,0:05:53.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,why did he knock on that door?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.26,0:06:00.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was probably on his way to get the inspector to help\Nget Kanbara-san out when the blackout occurred.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.10,0:06:05.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If you mean that room, the inspector asked the guards something.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.43,0:06:11.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He asked them while Oikawa-san was\Nstill inside checking the painting.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.57,0:06:14.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I remember.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.65,0:06:20.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He told me to make sure the police really turned off the camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.62,0:06:23.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He told me to knock once if it was still on.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.99,0:06:27.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I knocked twice, the signal for it being off.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.37,0:06:32.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A signal? Why didn't he come speak with you at the door again?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.79,0:06:38.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He probably thought I'd be able to see\Nthe incomplete pointing from the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.38,0:06:41.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you hear anything about the victim?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.80,0:06:44.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, two strange things.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.72,0:06:49.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There was a strangely shaped mark in the blood on his sweater...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.06,0:06:52.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And on his left thumb, there was a strange, round mark.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.36,0:07:00.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The odd mark in the blood is probably from his\Nwrist being in the way when his neck was cut.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.15,0:07:03.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I have no idea about the weird circle mark on his thumb, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.91,0:07:05.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then maybe, he...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.24,0:07:08.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey! Stop running around!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.83,0:07:09.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We're going home.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.91,0:07:12.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, but Kid hasn't been caught yet!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.17,0:07:16.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's a job for the police.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.17,0:07:20.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Isn't it your bed time?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.30,0:07:27.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since he would have used his hang glider\Nto get away, there's no escape line, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.18,0:07:28.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.18,0:07:31.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We can eliminate escape routes through the witnesses.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.64,0:07:33.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But isn't it strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.90,0:07:38.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even with the riot squads all around the\Nvilla, no one found a single hiding place.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.44,0:07:42.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's because we didn't spotlight any of the windows.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.86,0:07:43.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, see...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.07,0:07:46.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But isn't Kid's hang glider white?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.83,0:07:50.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He couldn't have used some sort of magic to disappear completely.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.33,0:07:52.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right, right. He's a magician.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.83,0:07:57.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This isn't just a simple hand trick, right, Conan-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.09,0:07:57.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.88,0:08:00.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hold it! I'm sorry for the interruption.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.55,0:08:01.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sure...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.51,0:08:07.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Whether he used a trick or not, if we can't prove it...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.14,0:08:10.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If that's so, can't we investigate it...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.43,0:08:12.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Using this as a hint?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.39,0:08:16.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For this, we'll need a newspaper and an empty cup.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.11,0:08:21.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,First, I'll take the cup and cover it with the newspaper.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.87,0:08:30.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Next, I'll lift it...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.70,0:08:32.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and move it to the middle.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.54,0:08:34.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.37,0:08:38.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,How miraculous! The cup's gone.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.25,0:08:43.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You can say whatever, but that isn't magic.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.97,0:08:50.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When you moved the cup, you let it fall into your lap so you\Ncould pound on the shape of the newspaper later, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.39,0:08:53.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Someone did that at the 1st division's\Nend of the year party back in the day.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.98,0:08:56.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh, my Dad mentioned that once.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.77,0:08:58.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I wonder who did it then...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.05,0:08:59.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.15,0:09:01.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, what does this prove!?
