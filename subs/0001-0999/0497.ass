Dialogue: 0,0:14:05.63,0:14:07.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was to learn how to contact them.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.39,0:14:16.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We wouldn't be able to find out how.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.10,0:14:21.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With his cell phone broken, he would be forced to choose a different method.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.32,0:14:28.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If the method was something we could observe, like a payphone or a net café...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.32,0:14:33.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We would know what sort of words and style they used for communication.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:33.91,0:14:39.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then we could pretend to be him and continue making contact after we've apprehended him.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.88,0:14:40.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:40.67,0:14:43.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, it wasn't this boy who made a mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.84,0:14:46.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was us, the FBI, who did.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.59,0:14:51.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We couldn't think of such a method, myself included.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:55.43,0:14:58.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Regardless, let's rest in shifts and prepare for them.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.08,0:15:21.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having the Organization coming here in a situation like this...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.84,0:15:25.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Somehow he seems happy about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:25.59,0:15:28.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Any other feeling would be a lie.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:28.88,0:15:34.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,By being able to cross swords with them directly, he has an opportunity to take revenge for his girlfriend.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.26,0:15:36.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Revenge for his girlfriend?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.22,0:15:39.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Shuu's girlfriend was murdered...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:40.39,0:15:42.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,By them several months ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.73,0:15:45.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems she was connected to the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.36,0:15:49.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Shuu said she tried to escape the Organization, so they eliminated her.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:50.28,0:15:53.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why did Akai-san have a relationship with a woman like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.32,0:15:54.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,To infiltrate the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:55.87,0:16:00.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She wasn't very high in the Organization herself, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:00.00,0:16:03.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her younger sister was a scientist for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.38,0:16:04.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Younger sister?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.63,0:16:05.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A scientist?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:06.59,0:16:09.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Akai-kun became acquainted with the younger sister.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.84,0:16:15.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,By using this connection with those around her, he cleverly slipped in with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:15.93,0:16:20.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was a member of the Organization under the name "Moroboshi Dai."
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.39,0:16:24.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This was five and two years ago, for three years only.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:25.36,0:16:28.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He made it well in the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:29.28,0:16:32.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At first, he didn't try to stand out too much, but he gradually distinguished himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.36,0:16:36.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The codename they gave him was "Rye."
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.12,0:16:41.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Eventually, he was called up to work with one of the executive members, the man called: "Gin."
Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.58,0:16:49.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We expected that if we could capture him, we could take the fight all the way to the boss.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.84,0:16:57.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, we had our FBI agents stake out the meeting place for the mission ahead of time, but he never showed.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.39,0:17:00.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We waited all through the night.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.97,0:17:03.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't tell me they found out he was with the FBI?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:03.52,0:17:04.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.44,0:17:07.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was due to a small mistake by an agent on lookout.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:08.06,0:17:10.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Due to that, Shuu was exiled from the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.11,0:17:13.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, Akai-san's girlfriend was killed afterwards?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.70,0:17:22.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems her younger sister was a very important person to the Organization, so they couldn't lay a hand her.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:23.50,0:17:27.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Shuu realized this and stopped seeing her shortly thereafter.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.96,0:17:35.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, even if he wanted to contact her, both she and her sister were moved shortly thereafter, so they lost contact.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:36.43,0:17:38.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The Organization thought that since she'd been influenced by the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.89,0:17:44.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They couldn't let her go free, considering she could be contacted in the future.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:45.27,0:17:48.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They became restless and presented her with a proposition.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.27,0:17:54.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If she could complete an assignment, they would let both her sister and her leave the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:54.82,0:17:59.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, the stipulation was that neither she nor her sister would live should she fail.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:00.24,0:18:05.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The Organization planned to use this as a pretext to get rid of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:05.83,0:18:10.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But she succeeded in her assignment, which was to procure one billion yen in a robbery.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.55,0:18:14.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They ended up killing her without a pretext anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:14.80,0:18:15.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey...
Dialogue: 0,0:18:15.88,0:18:17.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What was his girlfriend's name?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:17.76,0:18:20.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her real name was Miyano Akemi.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.10,0:18:22.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her alias was Hirota Masami.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.10,0:18:30.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, that scientist is Haibara!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.90,0:18:40.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We only know this much because Akai-kun received an e-mail from her on his cell phone the day before her mission.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.95,0:18:46.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There had been no messages from her for two years, ever since it was revealed that he was with the FBI.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.33,0:18:51.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Perhaps, even after knowing she had been used by the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:18:51.59,0:18:54.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She couldn't forget about Akai-kun.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.05,0:19:00.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And, when she died, you could guess from Akai-kun's behavior...
