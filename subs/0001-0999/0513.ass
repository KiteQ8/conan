Dialogue: 0,0:13:37.95,0:13:40.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But don't you think it's pretty strange?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.46,0:13:48.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Nah, I'll should just let it drop.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.04,0:13:49.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It's becoming silly.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:49.55,0:13:51.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Gu-Guess so.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.88,0:13:55.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿So, as I suspected, the cause of death was\N﻿hydrocyanic acid poisoning, wasn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.18,0:13:57.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿In regards to that...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:58.26,0:13:59.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿How's it going, Tome-san?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.76,0:14:03.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The details will have to wait until the autopsy, so it's hard to say...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:03.77,0:14:07.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿However, there's probably not much doubt.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:09.27,0:14:13.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The presumed time of death appears to\N﻿have been sometime after 6:30 PM.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.57,0:14:17.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But, don't you think you broke into the apartment rather soon?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.78,0:14:19.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Even cutting the chain lock.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.49,0:14:21.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It was something President Somei here said.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.54,0:14:26.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Nakame-san had recently been saying things\N﻿frequently about committing suicide.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.87,0:14:28.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿So I felt there might be an emergency.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.92,0:14:30.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:31.17,0:14:34.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Still, Inspector, we shouldn't discard the possibility of murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.42,0:14:37.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Eh? What's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.68,0:14:39.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Wasn't this a suicide?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.85,0:14:43.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The entryway door was locked and the chain lock was on.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.77,0:14:47.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, I do think this was a sealed room.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.60,0:14:51.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But since he drank poison, we can't be sure it was suicide.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.61,0:14:53.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I-Is that so?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:53.48,0:14:57.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The culprit might have come to visit\N﻿Nakame-san in his apartment, bringing the cake...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.36,0:14:59.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And after poisoning the coffee...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.07,0:15:02.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Got up to leave, claiming they had urgent business.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.45,0:15:05.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿While leaving, they could have said, "It's been unsafe recently."
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.87,0:15:07.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Making him set the chain lock.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.83,0:15:09.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿So this situation could have been easily created.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.75,0:15:12.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And so, after the culprit left...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.71,0:15:17.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Nakame-san could have returned to his\N﻿seat and drank the poisoned coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:17.59,0:15:18.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.34,0:15:20.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Incidentally...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.22,0:15:23.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Where were you at the presumed time of death, around 6:30 PM?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.06,0:15:26.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿A-Am I under suspicion?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.27,0:15:28.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, you were the one who discovered the body first, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:29.35,0:15:31.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I'm just asking to make sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.44,0:15:35.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I haven't been feeling well recently.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.94,0:15:38.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿After work was over, I went home to lie down.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.61,0:15:42.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then, at 6:30 exactly, I received a phone call from Mouri-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:43.66,0:15:46.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿He reminded me that we had an appointment\N﻿to meet Nakame-san tonight at 7:00.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.95,0:15:48.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And we came here.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:48.62,0:15:51.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I slept the whole day, so I was feeling better.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:52.67,0:15:56.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Wait a minute! Do you mean you'd forgotten\N﻿about the appointment for our meeting?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:56.80,0:15:58.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Yes. Please forgive me.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:58.30,0:16:01.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That call, did you take it on the phone at your house?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.01,0:16:02.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.85,0:16:05.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I took it on this cellphone.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:05.89,0:16:10.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then, is there anyone who can confirm you\N﻿were sleeping at home the whole day?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:11.10,0:16:12.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, there isn't.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.48,0:16:16.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But, proof? I knew it, you are suspecting me.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.28,0:16:18.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, no. Were just making sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:18.61,0:16:19.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Ah-re-re?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:21.70,0:16:23.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿What's so "ah-re-re"?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.03,0:16:27.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿This is strange. Underneath the saucer for this coffee cup.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.83,0:16:29.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Don't go touching things at random!
Dialogue: 0,0:16:29.54,0:16:30.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Can't you remember to stop fooling around?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:31.75,0:16:34.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Look, see the stain from when the coffee spilled?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.21,0:16:38.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Usually when it spills while it's still on the saucer...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.34,0:16:42.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿There should be a circular stain from the bottom of the plate.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.59,0:16:45.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But on this table there isn't a circular stain.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.55,0:16:48.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Instead there are these two weird thin lines.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.89,0:16:52.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And there's no coffee sticking to the underside of the plate either.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.19,0:16:54.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Hmm. That's true.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:55.56,0:17:01.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Could those two thin lines possibly be marks\N﻿from the coffee cup and its handle?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:03.61,0:17:06.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If the cup was left after the coffee inside it spilled...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:06.70,0:17:10.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then the place on the table where the coffee cup\N﻿and handle were resting wouldn't get wet.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.37,0:17:15.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If that was the case, it would have fallen\N﻿down after Nakame-san drank the poison.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.33,0:17:18.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That means someone placed the coffee\N﻿cup on its saucer on purpose...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.63,0:17:21.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And set them back on top of the table...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.30,0:17:23.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿After the coffee had dried.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:23.76,0:17:27.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But who would do that, and for what reason?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:28.51,0:17:30.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I don't know the reason they did it, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.23,0:17:33.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I do know who did it.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.44,0:17:37.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The one who could do this after the coffee had dried...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:37.98,0:17:41.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Was the one who came into the apartment\N﻿first and found Nakame-san's body.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.28,0:17:45.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It had to be the one who first discovered\N﻿the body, President Somei, doesn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:45.45,0:17:47.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Wait, Conan-kun, what are you saying?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.08,0:17:50.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Children say the oddest things.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.49,0:17:53.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Nope, it definitely couldn't have been anyone but you.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:54.71,0:17:58.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Spilled coffee would normally take an hour to dry.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.04,0:18:01.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If the presumed time of the crime was around 6:30 PM...
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.21,0:18:06.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿We got the key and went into the apartment after 7:30 PM.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:06.26,0:18:08.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, no, no. It was sometime before 8:00 PM, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.97,0:18:11.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The spilled coffee must have dried.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.14,0:18:18.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿You came into this sealed room first to hide some evidence\N﻿that you weren't able to remove earlier, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:18.27,0:18:20.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿With the saucer for the coffee cup!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.77,0:18:21.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Am I wrong?!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:23.82,0:18:25.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Like I said, what evidence?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.36,0:18:30.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿All that's under the saucer for the coffee\N﻿cup is the stain from the spilled coffee!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.24,0:18:34.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Why would I want to hide something like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.04,0:18:36.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The stain of spilled coffee?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.34,0:18:43.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿L-Let me go for a second!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.92,0:18:45.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Ran-neechan, let me go!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.01,0:18:46.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Hey, Conan-kun!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.43,0:18:58.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I was wrong, this isn't an ordinary murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:59.77,0:19:01.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It's an impossible crime!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:02.86,0:19:04.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿What wrong, Conan-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.44,0:19:05.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿You've got such a grim face.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:06.32,0:19:09.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Say, this stain from the spilled coffee...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:09.78,0:19:11.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Isn't there something strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:12.33,0:19:14.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Like we said, the saucer was placed there afterwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.54,0:19:15.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿On the floor. The floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.33,0:19:18.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Heh? Something strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.46,0:19:22.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The spilled coffee dropped from the table onto the chair.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:23.00,0:19:27.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then, furthermore, it just dripped down the\N﻿chair leg onto the carpet on the floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:28.26,0:19:30.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That was along the front left leg of the chair.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.18,0:19:34.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Look just a bit before the right front leg.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.56,0:19:38.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Isn't there a circular spot missing from the stain?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.48,0:19:40.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That means that when the coffee spilled...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:41.02,0:19:44.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The chair's front leg on the right side was there, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.32,0:19:44.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:45.65,0:19:47.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Why was it moved? This chair?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.74,0:19:50.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then, when this guy came into the room...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:51.28,0:19:53.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿For some reason, he moved that too.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:54.33,0:19:55.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Could you please stop it with the nonsense?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.16,0:19:57.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿But, isn't this strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.75,0:20:01.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The place where the stain is if he moved it after the coffee had dried.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.58,0:20:02.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Just like I said.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:03.46,0:20:04.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Look more closely.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.46,0:20:08.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The chair was placed like this at first...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:09.51,0:20:10.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Look!
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.72,0:20:15.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If you join up the right front leg with\N﻿the stain, the left side won't reach.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.27,0:20:17.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Oh?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:17.72,0:20:22.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Therefore when the coffee was spilled the chair was like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.40,0:20:27.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Then before the coffee dripped along the left front leg\N﻿onto the floor, it had to have moved like this, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:28.28,0:20:32.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That's true, but there's no way the chair could have moved on its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.28,0:20:35.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It's not like someone else was sitting in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.70,0:20:42.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Exactly. When the coffee spilled...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:42.33,0:20:46.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿This is clear proof that someone was sitting here.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:47.34,0:20:48.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Isn't that right, Uncle?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:49.26,0:20:50.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Huh? Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:51.43,0:20:53.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿W-Wait a second here.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.93,0:20:54.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If that's the case...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:55.26,0:20:58.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The entryway door was locked and the chain lock was attached.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:58.77,0:21:01.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And the fact that no one except the corpse was in this room means...
Dialogue: 0,0:21:01.48,0:21:02.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿It couldn't be...
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.77,0:21:04.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿An impossible crime.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.15,0:21:08.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That means, it's a sealed room murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:08.98,0:21:14.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿No, it could also be that when we came into the\N﻿apartment, the culprit was still lurking inside this room.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:15.16,0:21:17.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿And in the confusion, they slipped out and made their escape.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:17.45,0:21:18.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I don't think that's possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:20.37,0:21:24.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That's because I stayed at the entryway\N﻿the whole time, like Conan told me to.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:25.08,0:21:28.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Nobody came out of the room until the police arrived.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.09,0:21:30.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿What did you say?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:30.88,0:21:35.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Exactly. This was an impossible crime. A sealed room murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:36.14,0:21:40.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The TV producer, Nakame Raisaku-san, was killed by poisoned coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.73,0:21:49.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿A saucer was deceptively placed under the coffee cup\N﻿after the coffee spilled on top of the table had dried.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:49.90,0:21:56.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I suppose that was because the culprit had already left the\N﻿room when Nakame-san drank the poisoned coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:57.49,0:22:02.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The person who could have performed the deception could only\N﻿have been the one who first discovered the body, Somei-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.50,0:22:10.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿However, the coffee stain on the floor was\N﻿from it running down the leg of the chair.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:10.55,0:22:15.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿I realized that someone was sitting in\N﻿that chair when the coffee spilled.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:15.63,0:22:20.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿If that person was the culprit, how\N﻿did they escape from this apartment?
Dialogue: 0,0:22:21.10,0:22:26.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿When we got to the apartment, the entry door\N﻿was locked and the chain lock attached.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:27.65,0:22:29.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿A sealed room murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:29.52,0:22:32.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿What kind of trick did the culprit use?
Dialogue: 0,0:24:00.28,0:24:03.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿Another of your trademark "Ah-re-re"s?
Dialogue: 0,0:24:03.66,0:24:05.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿That's the third time today.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:06.20,0:24:08.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿This boy is hungry, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:24:08.33,0:24:11.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿He'd like to eat the cake that's on top of the table.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:12.75,0:24:15.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The aroma of coffee. It's just as I thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:17.21,0:24:18.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿In that case, there's only one answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:19.93,0:24:23.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,﻿The sad truth is the only one.
