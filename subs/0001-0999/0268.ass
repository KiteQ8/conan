Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.29,0:06:16.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The reason the dog does that, is because the previous owner...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.87,0:06:20.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,had trained Saburo to guard his ex-wife's grave all day.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.42,0:06:25.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What are you talking about?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.17,0:06:30.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The dog goes to sleep in his cage every night. How could he go visit the graves?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.14,0:06:35.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes, that would be impossible, if there was only one dog.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.23,0:06:46.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Granny's husband told her that Saburo had a twin named Jiro, who "died" 12 years ago.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.87,0:07:01.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There are actually two Saburo's, and the mark on the chocolate was a dog bite!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.67,0:07:07.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Simply put, the other dog is Jiro.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.71,0:07:12.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Both dogs took turns to visit the grave each day.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.55,0:07:18.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For some reason, Granny's husband decided to keep Jiro a secret by faking his death.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.06,0:07:20.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Now I get it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.69,0:07:24.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were trained to eat every other day.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.65,0:07:31.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why one wouldn't eat whenever there was a storm, because they rotated eating schedules each day, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.82,0:07:35.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, the legendary Japanese wolf that Nigaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r} saw five years ago was.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.74,0:07:39.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That was probably either Jiro or Saburo.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.33,0:07:42.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They also brought chocolates to other victims.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.83,0:07:44.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Are you crazy?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.46,0:07:47.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They're just regular dogs, so how could they bring chocolate to victims?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.34,0:07:49.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, they aren't regular dogs.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.09,0:07:54.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They're famous search-and-rescue dogs that even received medals for their work.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.89,0:08:03.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They were trained to give a chocolate to each victim that they found.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.77,0:08:12.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, they can only do this during this time of year, since there are a lot more chocolates in the lodge.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.70,0:08:16.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Also, the reason why some of the blood on Nigaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s face was wiped off,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.95,0:08:20.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,was because the dog thought he was a victim, and licked his face in order to wake him up.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.83,0:08:23.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.21,0:08:26.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If the dog put the chocolate there, the criminal could be anyone, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.38,0:08:28.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What are you talking about?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.92,0:08:29.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Didn't you see it?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.34,0:08:35.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The blood-spotted photo was taken in the afternoon, right after Nigaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r} was attacked.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.60,0:08:41.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, the criminal must be one of you two who don't have an alibi during that time.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.43,0:08:44.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you see anything strange in that photo?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.73,0:08:51.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since that photo was the last one taken, the film rewound.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.32,0:08:55.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You know how it makes that "jii" sound when it's rewinding?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.28,0:08:57.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The criminal must've heard it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.49,0:09:02.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, for some reason, the culprit didn't take the film,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.58,0:09:06.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,even though there was a chance that their picture might have been on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.29,0:09:08.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's true.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.29,0:09:10.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, why?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.63,0:09:16.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because that picture was not taken when the attack occurred.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.30,0:09:21.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was just a normal picture Nigaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} took in the afternoon.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.97,0:09:27.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,However, he didn't know that his blood had been on the camera since the night before.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.69,0:09:31.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Last night? You don't mean when he cut his finger with the knife?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.23,0:09:32.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.40,0:09:38.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The proof is that there wasn't any blood in the middle of the sweatshirt he was wearing.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.49,0:09:43.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Most likely, the camera was hanging from his neck, and the blood got splashed onto the lens.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.70,0:09:51.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, the culprit told Nigaki{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} to take a picture with the now blood-covered camera in the afternoon.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.80,0:09:56.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They met up with him again in the evening, attacked him,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.13,0:10:02.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and put sunglasses on him to make us think he was killed in the afternoon.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.72,0:10:08.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, the only one who could be the culprit is you!
