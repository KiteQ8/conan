Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.43,0:11:29.57,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,I think blood dripped from the body when we were carrying it...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.57,0:11:33.51,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,No, not all of the blood was from then.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.77,0:11:37.78,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,It's hard to tell, since it's mixed with other blood,

Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.51,0:11:44.52,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The shape that drops of human blood make
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.52,0:11:48.72,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,is pretty much determined by how far they fall.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.72,0:11:51.46,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The farther the fall, the larger the circle,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.46,0:11:54.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and the more developed the surrounding splatter is.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.93,0:11:57.83,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,If you had carried her by her arms and legs,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.83,0:12:01.47,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,the distance from her toenails to the floor was 50 cm at best.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.47,0:12:07.27,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,However, these blood drops clearly fell more than a meter.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.27,0:12:10.24,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The fact that such blood is here...
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.24,0:12:14.11,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you saying she was on top of this shelf?

Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.42,0:12:25.93,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes. The killer had carried her to the top of the shelf last night...
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.93,0:12:31.96,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,...where she slept, with a rope around her neck, tied to the roof beam.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:31.96,0:12:36.14,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,That way, when she woke in the morning, she would lose her balance,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.14,0:12:41.74,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,fall from the shelf, and wind up hanging herself.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:41.74,0:12:45.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The loud sound right after she was hanged
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.04,0:12:50.72,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,was from the pots left directly below the noose.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.72,0:12:55.89,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Being hanged from that height would result in an almost instant death.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.89,0:13:03.80,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The broken pots would then look like a stepstool she had overturned.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.80,0:13:07.80,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, this was also meant to hasten the body's discovery
Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.80,0:13:12.41,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,and solidify the alibi of the killer inside the stateroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:12.41,0:13:15.94,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Then what about the cut on her right calf?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.94,0:13:21.08,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Look closely at the top of the shelf. Do you see a protruding nail?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:21.08,0:13:23.08,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes, I do.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.08,0:13:31.02,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,When she lost her balance and fell, she likely cut her calf on that nail.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.02,0:13:33.63,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,The blood landed on a different spot on the floor
Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.63,0:13:37.16,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,probably because she had held on to the shelf for a few seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:37.16,0:13:41.60,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Meaning she just happened to get the cut on her calf?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.60,0:13:46.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes. It wasn't part of the killer's plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.04,0:13:50.68,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,He was probably quite shocked when he saw her cut.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.68,0:13:55.45,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,But the killer would've quickly discovered the cause of it,

Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.30,0:14:16.57,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,the killer directed the others carrying her body to the blood
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.57,0:14:19.17,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,to try to hide it with new blood.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.33,0:14:46.17,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Besides, why would I do something so daring

Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.53,0:14:51.30,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,You had no other choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.30,0:14:55.04,Dialogue,,0000,0000,0000,,Because she had broken the Fusui-maru.
