Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.59,0:13:18.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then maybe it's Saori{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}. She told you to\Neat proper meals and take a bath, didn't she?

Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.02,0:14:51.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, now. First of all, I'd open the window for ventilation.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.03,0:14:56.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're not saying Tago is out on the veranda are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.95,0:14:58.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.03,0:15:01.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At any cost, he needed you to open it.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.12,0:15:07.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Earlier, after we left the veranda...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.71,0:15:14.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You locked the window, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.46,0:15:19.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it. Since you always leave the window open...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.22,0:15:24.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He expected you to leave it open when\Nyou went to sleep after finishing the model.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.68,0:15:30.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. As long as you left the window open for him, he could\Npeer through the curtains to see what was going on in the room.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.19,0:15:34.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But when we went out there earlier there was nobody there.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:36.11,0:15:38.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Eh? Where we could see...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:40.28,0:15:45.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You see it now, right? That's why he told you to\Ndo the washing and the laundry when you woke up.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.59,0:15:56.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right. He said that because...

Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.23,0:16:13.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Incidentally, the reason he told you he would\Ncome in the morning and do the washing was...

Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.84,0:16:42.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Of course, his height and physique\NI asked you about was the deciding factor.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.93,0:16:51.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since he used that chair as a footstool in order to get the album\Nfrom the top shelf of the bookcase, the culprit must be a short person.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.14,0:16:56.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, if he wasn't a fairly short person,\Nhe couldn't hide inside that washing machine.
