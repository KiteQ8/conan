Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.07,0:06:53.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They left such an important task to just one man.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.66,0:08:25.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You handed Mizunashi Rena over to the Organization on purpose!?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.71,0:08:30.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why I had Camel call attention to his driving skills.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.47,0:08:36.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way, he would be the obvious choice to drive the car taking Mizunashi Rena from the hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.72,0:08:40.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, we led them to figure it out...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.52,0:08:42.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And let them recover her.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.85,0:08:48.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right, we gave them the impression that they had figured out our plan and had completely outwitted us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.19,0:08:52.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's the strategy this boy and I carefully crafted.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.69,0:08:54.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,T-Then, wait...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.28,0:08:59.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You mean my getting knocked out by this gorilla was also part of your scheme!?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.62,0:09:04.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I gave him instructions to silence anyone who got in the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.87,0:09:12.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Also, we were fortunate that we could make them the driver had been killed using their own bomb.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.05,0:09:20.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He had the car drift so the driver's side was facing the guardrail.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.35,0:09:25.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In order to escape, the door had to come to a perfect position.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.06,0:09:31.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he didn't match his escape with the timing of the explosion, the plan would have failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.49,0:09:40.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't entrust that to someone with such poor driving skills as you, now could I?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.37,0:09:43.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,B-But...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.91,0:09:47.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mizunashi Rena was our only thread to them...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.58,0:09:50.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,How could you stand by and let them take her?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.21,0:09:54.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I made an arrangement with her last night.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.76,0:09:59.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,An arrangement to make her not just a thread, but a fishing line for the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.22,0:10:04.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And one that would make her a part of this boy's scheme.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.94,0:10:10.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You never fail to amaze, kid.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.77,0:10:13.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm just glad you're an ally, Akai{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
