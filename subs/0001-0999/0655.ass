Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.70,0:05:04.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since their shapes are similar!

Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.93,0:06:48.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems he received it from the president\Nin celebration of thirty years of service.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.68,0:06:53.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think he said the other employees were presented\Nwith wristwatches also made of bronze.
