Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.65,0:16:19.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right. I'm guessing that whoever did it must have seen a little of the code which the professor wrote on the floor,

Dialogue: 0,0:16:47.65,0:16:51.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe it has something to do with those symbols.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.11,0:16:52.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Symbols?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:52.34,0:16:54.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Those symbols that you discovered.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.00,0:17:14.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah professor, what did the police say?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:14.11,0:17:18.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They said that this was most likely done by a thief.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.61,0:17:21.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They'll come and investigate tomorrow. So it'll be best if you guys leave everything as it is right now.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.78,0:17:30.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right. Even though that code is very mysterious,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.62,0:17:32.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I wouldn't want to do anything to the scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.86,0:17:38.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey! What are you guys doing?

Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.57,0:17:49.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Conan-kun, I found another!

Dialogue: 0,0:18:06.19,0:18:07.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wha?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:15.76,0:18:17.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe it was just me.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.94,0:18:30.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Conan-kun, I found another one!

Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.64,0:18:33.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,None here either.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.02,0:18:39.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So now, we have found a total of seven different codes.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.16,0:18:50.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,On a card, a French đictionary, a record, an airplane, awine glass, a painting, and this doll.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:52.50,0:18:57.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Now that I think about it, I've heard my aunt say that when my uncle was still alive, he really treasured that doll.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.99,0:19:00.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the three which we've found earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.42,0:19:06.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A plate, a candlestick, and a flower vase. So a total of 10 objects.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:07.28,0:19:09.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But after having gathered all these objects,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:09.51,0:19:10.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,we still don't understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:10.82,0:19:15.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. If only the code would be longer, and more similar to regular writing, that'd make things easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:15.89,0:19:18.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Like for an example, maybe having the code written a diary or maybe a letter of some sort.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:18.32,0:19:19.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Letter?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.63,0:19:22.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh yeah! Now I remember!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.78,0:19:24.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There was a letter!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.44,0:19:25.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wha?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:25.35,0:19:27.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Didn't I mention?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.20,0:19:29.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That I've seen that code somewhere before?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:29.84,0:19:32.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A while ago, my aunt showed me.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.30,0:19:34.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But I completely forgot.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.04,0:19:36.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Are you talking about that lady in the painting?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.71,0:19:40.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That person who you said had onced worked as a teacher?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.01,0:19:44.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. That's right. That happened around five or six years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.95,0:19:50.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She had recieved a letter every year for ten years that didn't have a sender's name on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.09,0:19:53.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the address and name on the letter was to her.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:53.86,0:19:56.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since it was so strange, my aunt had let me see it. I still remember that the content of the letter was written entirely using hiragana.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.66,0:20:01.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"How do you do?" "God bless." Etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.31,0:20:03.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe one of her students sent it to her?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.11,0:20:07.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No. Since all of the letters within the ten years that have been sent were only written using hiragana.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:08.58,0:20:10.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's indeed strange.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.78,0:20:15.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What was special about that letter and the code?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.25,0:20:17.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The code was drawn everywhere,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:17.18,0:20:20.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,starting from the four corners of that hiragana letter.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:20.88,0:20:23.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just like a fancy pattern.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:25.13,0:20:27.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So what did the letter mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:27.81,0:20:30.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I really didn't know, so I went to ask that person,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:30.59,0:20:34.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,your da...no, err... my good neighbor,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.20,0:20:36.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,who worked as an author.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.57,0:20:38.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Dad saw it?!
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.54,0:20:41.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Though even that author didn't even know that letter had meant.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:42.21,0:20:44.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At first, he didn't seem to happy about it,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.45,0:20:48.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but once he saw the letter, he seemed really excited.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:49.32,0:20:52.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He took the letter with him back to his place,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.29,0:20:55.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and came back out within a few minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:20:55.76,0:20:57.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and told me that,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:58.69,0:21:01.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"give these letters back to your aunt for me,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:01.67,0:21:04.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,this is just too exciting.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:04.55,0:21:07.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Professor, you're just like the sun.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:07.51,0:21:10.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You always turn my horrible mood around."
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.81,0:21:14.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What did that letter say?!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.43,0:21:15.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I have no idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:15.78,0:21:18.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,My guess is that it must have been the answer to the code.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:18.96,0:21:19.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.95,0:21:23.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right. That author had figured that out that,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:23.92,0:21:27.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the code was also written in hiragana.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:27.69,0:21:29.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hiragana?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.25,0:21:30.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Are you for real, Conan?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:30.73,0:21:34.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. The letter was written using hiragana,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:34.28,0:21:39.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so you just needed to use hiragana, to read the symbols of the four corners.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:39.12,0:21:40.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.00,0:21:49.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Judging by the code on the letter and the painting, should be the same person who did all this.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:49.45,0:21:53.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why does that person need to write that code, to my aunt?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:53.65,0:21:56.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That person probably didn't want other people do know besides her.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.99,0:21:59.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For example, if he was being chased by someone at that time.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.76,0:22:02.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh yeah, my aunt had said that
Dialogue: 0,0:22:02.49,0:22:06.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,there was often a strange person who'd go and steal her mail
Dialogue: 0,0:22:07.57,0:22:10.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm guessing that person is the same criminal who did that to the toys.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:12.00,0:22:16.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So there really is a secret within this house.

Dialogue: 0,0:23:49.57,0:23:52.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What? There's nothing here.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:54.20,0:23:56.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's those symbols again, on the ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:56.61,0:24:00.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wait! If I put them in order then... that would mean...
