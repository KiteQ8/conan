Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.78,0:20:15.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What was special about that letter and the code?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.25,0:20:17.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The code was drawn everywhere,

Dialogue: 0,0:20:25.13,0:20:27.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So what did the letter mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:27.81,0:20:30.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I really didn't know, so I went to ask that person,

Dialogue: 0,0:21:39.12,0:21:40.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.00,0:21:49.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Judging by the code on the letter and the painting, should be the same person who did all this.
