Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.75,0:05:39.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The important issue here is the second murder.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.00,0:05:41.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,From the situation at the crime scene,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.56,0:05:45.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,it looks like the killer walked along the shore to get to and from the crime scene,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.25,0:05:48.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,with the footprints being washed away by the waves.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.72,0:06:07.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,those fish scales really had me fooled...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.40,0:06:10.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the killer dropped the scales around the footprints
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.15,0:06:14.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,then on Naoko's clothes after killing her, that way,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.09,0:06:21.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,with the scales leading to the water, the killer made it look like a mermaid act & that it escaped into the ocean...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.25,0:06:26.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the only people who could've snuck out of the funeral at that time...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.60,0:06:29.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,...were Rokuro{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and Benzo{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.73,0:06:31.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It couldn't be...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.46,0:06:34.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let me ask you something, Benzo{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.09,0:06:36.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,On the morning of the festival,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.61,0:06:40.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,you sold an Arrow of Dugong to an elderly couple for 1,000,000 yen, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.48,0:06:45.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. The arrow my daughter Saori won last year.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.71,0:06:48.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm her guardian, so I got every right to do what I want with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.49,0:06:52.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That 1,000,000 yen whetted your appetite for more money.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.28,0:06:56.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,After Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} won an arrow this year,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.14,0:06:58.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,you lured her to the top of the waterfall and killed her to steal her winning ticket!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.83,0:07:02.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You put her body in a swim ring so it wouldn't get stuck in the river!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.36,0:07:03.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But that wasn't all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.30,0:07:06.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Next, Naoko{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}, who'd also won an arrow at the festivalâ€”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.58,0:07:11.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,you called her out on the night of the funeral, killed her and stole her arrow!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.31,0:07:14.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But if the records at the shrine were checked,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.35,0:07:17.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,everyone would find out that Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s ticket was stolen.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.25,0:07:21.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So you went to Kimie{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s house before we got there to steal the notebook,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.92,0:07:27.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but Kimie{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} caught you, so you locked her in the warehouse and burned it down!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.14,0:07:32.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This notebook you had when we caught you is proof!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.33,0:07:35.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We found your fingerprints on that inner tube!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.54,0:07:38.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No. Benzo{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} didn't do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.48,0:07:41.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If Benzo{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} were the killer,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.52,0:07:44.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,he could've destroyed the notebook in the warehouse fire.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.95,0:07:49.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All the locals knew where to find the notebook anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.19,0:07:52.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't think he'd have to rush over to steal it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.40,0:07:56.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Another thing, it would have been very hard for him to call Naoko out...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.05,0:08:02.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Naoko noticed that Toshimi won an arrow at the festival too,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.75,0:08:07.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and she was suspicious of Benzo who had that winning number...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.72,0:08:10.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What about his prints on the swim ring?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.25,0:08:14.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He probably found the ticket and the swim ring floating in the river.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.99,0:08:18.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He must've touched the swim ring while trying to pick up the ticket.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.77,0:08:21.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the detective's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.49,0:08:25.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I was afraid everybody would think I was the killer, if they knew whose ticket I had
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.05,0:08:27.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so I stole the notebook...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.70,0:08:32.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, Rokuro Fukuyama, {\i1}you{\i0} must be the killer!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.32,0:08:33.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What? That's ridiculous!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.16,0:08:36.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Toshimi was your fiancee, wasn't she?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.85,0:08:39.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She could have gone to meet you at the waterfall with no suspicions...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.29,0:08:41.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, it wasn't him, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.95,0:08:43.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.28,0:08:46.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The killer used the swim ring trick to hang Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.78,0:08:51.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She'd float down the waterfall without getting caught on anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.45,0:08:53.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way it would look like an accident.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.90,0:08:55.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But being a fisherman, Rokuro{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} has very strong arms,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.86,0:08:58.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} wasn't very heavy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.14,0:09:01.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,so it would have been easier for him to just toss her into the river.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.62,0:09:06.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He wouldn't have had to use a swim ring, which would only be left behind as evidence.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.08,0:09:10.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But if neither of them is the killer, then who is?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.98,0:09:16.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The killer made it look like Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s death was an accident,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.41,0:09:20.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but made no attempt to hide the fact that Naoko{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} was murdered.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:24.44,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you know what that means?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.44,0:09:28.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, uh... No, I don't...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.02,0:09:29.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} was killed,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.97,0:09:34.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the police didn't arrive right away because the sea was too rough.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.25,0:09:38.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally, the police would have arrived sometime that night.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.12,0:09:39.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And since it was a case of murder,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.80,0:09:41.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the investigation would have been intense.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.40,0:09:43.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The killer wouldn't have been able to move about freely.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.74,0:09:46.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why it had to look like an accident.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.88,0:09:53.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Which means the killer planned to kill Naoko{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and Toshimi{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} from the start.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.67,0:09:59.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But no one would have known Naoko had won an arrow until she came forward.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.49,0:10:00.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.84,0:10:04.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The killer's motive wasn't to steal an arrow,
