Dialogue: 0,1:44:01.99,1:44:05.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they didn't expect us to be there a long time ago...
Dialogue: 0,1:44:06.33,1:44:08.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It'd be impossible for them to take\Nup that position on that building.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:09.08,1:44:09.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then...
Dialogue: 0,1:44:09.96,1:44:12.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mouri Kogorou and the FBI joined forces and...
Dialogue: 0,1:44:12.67,1:44:14.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't think so.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:14.42,1:44:19.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,To the FBI, he was just bait for us to bite.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:20.01,1:44:24.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Otherwise, why would they leave\Ntheir own comrade in such danger?
Dialogue: 0,1:44:26.56,1:44:31.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They probably got information\Nabout the meeting of Kir and him...
Dialogue: 0,1:44:31.02,1:44:38.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And after they parted, it was the FBI who planted\Nthe wireless tap and the transmitter on Kir's shoe.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:38.45,1:44:43.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way, should they be found,\Nwe would no doubt eye him first.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:46.29,1:44:47.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'll leave it at that for now.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:48.75,1:44:52.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since it seems Mouri Kogorou\Nis your favorite detective.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:53.96,1:44:55.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:55.59,1:44:58.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the problem is Kir.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:58.63,1:45:00.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't tell me, the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,1:45:00.47,1:45:01.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:01.64,1:45:04.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No doubt she tell into their hands.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:04.60,1:45:08.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, I don't think Kir will crack that easily.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:08.73,1:45:11.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'll definitely find her using\Nwhatever means necessary.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:12.02,1:45:14.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh, do you have any clues?
Dialogue: 0,1:45:14.94,1:45:18.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, clues are rolling about everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:18.20,1:45:20.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, this Mouri Kogorou...
Dialogue: 0,1:45:20.70,1:45:23.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't consider him completely clean just yet.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:29.21,1:45:31.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Did you see the news this morning?
Dialogue: 0,1:45:31.54,1:45:32.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:32.46,1:45:37.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The news said Domon{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} postponed\Nrunning for election this time, right?
Dialogue: 0,1:45:37.59,1:45:42.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The reason is due to the finding of his father's\Nadulterous affairs as a former bureaucrat.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:42.39,1:45:44.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And it was from twenty years ago, no less.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:44.47,1:45:48.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He tried to cut a deal with Nichiuri\Nto hold down this discovery...
Dialogue: 0,1:45:48.35,1:45:52.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In exchange, Domon{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} would\Nagree to an exclusive interview.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:52.19,1:45:54.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it seems that was planned\Nby Mizunashi Rena on her own.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:55.36,1:45:58.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The TV station didn't know\Nanything about the deal.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:00.86,1:46:06.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, had they known he's the honest type who\Nwould give up running for office over such a thing...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:06.29,1:46:08.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I doubt they'd have gone through all that trouble.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:09.54,1:46:11.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But those people...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:11.12,1:46:13.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If we could've caught at least two or three of them...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:14.46,1:46:17.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I could have shot through their legs, but...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:17.00,1:46:20.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I decided to let them off by just putting\Nshells through their bulletproof jackets.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:21.26,1:46:25.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If I had pushed them too much and the\Nshooting were to break out into the city...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:25.10,1:46:27.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There could've been victims from the public.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:28.52,1:46:29.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In this case...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:29.52,1:46:35.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Our top priority was to lead them to think the\Ntap and transmitter were planted by the FBI.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:35.56,1:46:37.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Isn't that so?
Dialogue: 0,1:46:37.44,1:46:38.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're right, but...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:39.03,1:46:40.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, our connection to them...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:43.86,1:46:45.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hasn't been entirely severed.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:47.20,1:46:51.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her life's not in any danger, but\Nshe's not regaining consciousness.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:51.79,1:46:54.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems we just have to wait for her to recover.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:54.50,1:46:58.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They've agreed to keep the fact\Nshe's hospitalized here a secret.
Dialogue: 0,1:46:58.09,1:46:58.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,1:46:58.92,1:47:03.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With an announcer disappearing all of sudden,\NI doubt the TV station will just keep quiet.
Dialogue: 0,1:47:06.05,1:47:07.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't worry.
Dialogue: 0,1:47:07.01,1:47:07.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That kid...

Dialogue: 0,1:47:13.27,1:47:14.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Who is he?
Dialogue: 0,1:47:14.94,1:47:16.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A detective.
Dialogue: 0,1:47:16.52,1:47:18.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,My favorite one.
Dialogue: 0,1:47:20.73,1:47:22.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Is this the personnel manager?
Dialogue: 0,1:47:22.11,1:47:23.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is Mizunashi Rena.
Dialogue: 0,1:47:23.74,1:47:25.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm terribly sorry, but...
Dialogue: 0,1:47:25.70,1:47:27.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Would you please grant me a vacation?
Dialogue: 0,1:48:55.08,1:48:56.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You were lucky.
Dialogue: 0,1:48:56.96,1:49:00.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They suspected Detective Mouri\Nwho went around with you...
Dialogue: 0,1:49:00.33,1:49:02.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Which almost got him assassinated by them.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:02.96,1:49:04.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, he was saved at the very last moment.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:05.38,1:49:09.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, expecting things would turn out that\Nway, that guy ambushed them in hiding.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:09.80,1:49:13.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And he made them think the wireless tap\Nand transmitter were planted by the FBI.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:14.22,1:49:16.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, you should thank that person named Akai.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:17.14,1:49:19.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I'm really grateful to him.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:19.77,1:49:23.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And I also thank you for holding onto Ran\Nand hiding her at the professor's place.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:23.69,1:49:25.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, is this all right?
Dialogue: 0,1:49:25.78,1:49:29.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It doesn't seem Detective Mouri has\Nany bodyguards with him after that.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:29.74,1:49:31.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's safer that way.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:31.74,1:49:34.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why I rejected the FBI's security offer.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:34.24,1:49:38.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since we finally got them to think\NUncle and the FBI are unrelated...
Dialogue: 0,1:49:39.08,1:49:41.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If they guard him tactlessly...
Dialogue: 0,1:49:41.00,1:49:46.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then they'll think he's related to the FBI after\Nall, and that will be much more dangerous.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:46.00,1:49:47.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I know, but...
Dialogue: 0,1:49:47.51,1:49:52.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, we still have one card\Nwe've acquired from them.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:52.43,1:49:54.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Announcer Mizunashi Rena{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}, right?
Dialogue: 0,1:49:56.14,1:49:59.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I heard she's still unconscious and hospitalized.
Dialogue: 0,1:49:59.23,1:50:02.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the FBI's guarding her 24-hours straight...
Dialogue: 0,1:50:02.69,1:50:05.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And waiting for her to wake up.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:05.44,1:50:08.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, what if they sniff out that hospital?
Dialogue: 0,1:50:08.82,1:50:10.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's fine.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:10.11,1:50:13.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I called the TV station using her voice,\Nand asked for a long-term vacation.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:14.78,1:50:17.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So even they wouldn't suspect she's hospitalized.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:18.58,1:50:21.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At any rate, don't let your guard down.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:21.21,1:50:26.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure they're frantically looking for\Nher whereabouts with bloodshot eyes.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:26.67,1:50:27.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:27.42,1:50:28.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Those guys...
