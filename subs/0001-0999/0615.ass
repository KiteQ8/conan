Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.96,0:13:54.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The result is, the pages at the end are in fact\Na bit larger than the pages in the middle.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.13,0:14:00.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why, if a page from the back is inserted\Ninto the middle, it would stick out like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.68,0:14:05.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The reason why the staple tips in the middle page were\Nnot aligned together was because of that as well.
