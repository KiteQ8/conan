Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.24,0:03:56.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right. Earlier, you said that you were a fisherman's daughter.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.95,0:04:01.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, Shirane{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} knows a lot about fishing, so she was rather popular in the fishing club.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.69,0:04:48.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If that's the case, then the fisherman Ida{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} would also be a suspect, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.04,0:04:59.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.98,0:05:05.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and I divorced three years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.82,0:05:07.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Eh? Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.55,0:05:08.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because of several reasons...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.35,0:05:15.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But we both still really like fishing, so I still ask him out to fish during the holidays with Kanetani{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r} and me.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.76,0:05:19.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, do you always make lunch for everyone?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.54,0:05:33.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It does look the same as Kanetani{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s lunch box.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.55,0:05:36.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't tell me there was poison inside the lunch!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.75,0:05:39.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No way! I wouldn't do anything like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.32,0:05:47.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,After all, I received those two lunch boxes from Shirane{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and gave one of them to Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.36,0:05:51.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since they look exactly alike, she wouldn't know which one I'd hand to him,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.23,0:05:54.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So she couldn't have put poison in the lunches.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.27,0:05:56.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah... I guess you're right...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.87,0:05:59.17,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}There's a fishing stand in the water.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.27,0:06:03.64,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}This must be one of the two stands that Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Thoughts\be10}-san{\r\be10} was using.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.84,0:06:08.28,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}The other one is still standing there, so why?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.42,0:06:20.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hmm... We don't have any leads on this case yet...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.16,0:06:25.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe he put the poison on the fishhook and cast it so that it'd catch Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and poison him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.57,0:06:28.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right! Casting is a basic skill for fishing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.60,0:06:29.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's not possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.14,0:06:35.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having the hook touch his exposed skin on one cast would be pure luck.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.97,0:06:40.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And if the poisoned fishhook was dropped into the sea for even a moment, the sea water would've washed most of the poison away.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.98,0:06:42.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So... It still comes down to the lunch box.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.18,0:06:45.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, the possibility of that is very low.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.12,0:06:48.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Had something like poisoned food gone past his mouth,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.76,0:06:53.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When I did artificial respiration on him, I would have been poisoned as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.09,0:06:54.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.20,0:06:59.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then you already knew that the poison wasn't introduced through the mouth at the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.77,0:07:03.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, I couldn't tell where the poison was introduced just by giving him a quick scan.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.37,0:07:08.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All I know is that if I hadn't done artificial respiration on him at that time,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.34,0:07:12.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He would've died over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.65,0:07:20.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, say... Can't this boat go faster?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.29,0:07:23.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Stop rushing, Officer.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.56,0:07:26.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What's that smell?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.16,0:07:28.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, hey... Isn't this boat smoking?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.26,0:07:31.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's all because you kept telling us to go faster and faster!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.53,0:07:34.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The police sure are slow...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.84,0:07:37.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah... But it should be okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.24,0:07:43.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit is one of those two for sure, so we just need to keep our eyes on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.41,0:07:47.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the fisherman uncle wasn't here the entire time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.12,0:07:49.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I wouldn't be so sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.82,0:07:56.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he found some way to feed Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} some slow-acting sleeping pill,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.59,0:07:59.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When he came here to pick us up...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.00,0:08:04.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He might have pretended to say that Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} was being strange, gotten close to him, and pricked him with a poison needle.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.70,0:08:06.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wait a second.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.20,0:08:10.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You let the professor go with someone who could be the murderer?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.17,0:08:14.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. To save Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}'s life, that was the only way.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.58,0:08:20.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And to make sure nothing happens, I've already given the professor my stun watch.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.72,0:08:24.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, the professor will call us if anything happens...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.69,0:08:26.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A call?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.26,0:08:28.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hello? Professor? Hel...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.03,0:08:34.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, Shin'ichi. We just delivered Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} to the ambulance.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.20,0:08:36.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And how is his condition?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.73,0:08:41.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We still can't be sure. We don't even know what kind of poison it was.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.01,0:08:47.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe the doctor can find out what it was after taking a look at his left wrist.
