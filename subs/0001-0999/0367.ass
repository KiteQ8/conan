Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.81,0:06:41.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the sea water would've washed most of the poison away.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.07,0:06:42.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So... It still comes down to the lunch box.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.27,0:06:45.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, the possibility of that is very low.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.21,0:06:49.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Had something like poisoned food gone past his mouth,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.86,0:07:03.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, I couldn't tell where the poison was introduced\Njust by giving him a quick scan.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.46,0:07:08.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All I know is that if I hadn't done artificial\Nrespiration on him at that time,

Dialogue: 0,0:11:30.17,0:11:33.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's no problem. The professor, who's on\Nthe same boat, is keeping watch on him.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.49,0:11:53.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Didn't I say? If Ida-san is the culprit,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.66,0:11:59.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He has to get close to an already sleeping Ejiri-san and apply the poison needle.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.16,0:12:02.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The poison used was probably some kind of nerve toxin.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.17,0:12:08.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even though he'd have difficulty breathing, he would still\Nbe conscious enough to remember that he was poked.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.84,0:12:13.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit would be afraid of that so he wouldn't immediately\Ndeliver the guy to the hospital like that.

Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.80,0:12:19.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,he would have escaped sometime along the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.32,0:12:24.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because when the poison is cleared out of Ejiri-san's system and\Nhe can talk again, everything would be revealed immediately.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.66,0:12:30.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see. So that means the culprit has to\Nbe either Shirane-san or Kanetani-san.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.07,0:13:16.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In fishing term, "omatsuri" means one fishing\Nline is tangled with another fishing line.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.28,0:13:22.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see! In order to detangle the fishing line,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.79,0:13:26.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,the person has to touch the fishhook. The culprit used this trick to poison the victim.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.55,0:13:28.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, what that fisherman uncle said...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.62,0:13:32.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't be too excited, it will be really bad\Nif you and your friend did "omatsuri."

Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.69,0:13:40.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the culprit made sure to tangle his\Nfishing line with Ejiri-san's fishing line,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.27,0:13:48.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So when Ejiri-san fried to detangle the lines, a slight pull on\Nthe line would cause the poison hook to scratch his hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.67,0:13:50.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, didn't you say it before as well?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.11,0:13:55.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Putting the hook in the sea for even a\Nmoment would wash away the poison.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.48,0:14:00.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. It's impossible to have poison stick with the hook as it is,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.82,0:14:03.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But it's a different matter if you use plastic glue.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.36,0:14:05.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Glue?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.16,0:14:09.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. You put the poison inside the glue than cover\Nthe poison with glue on the surface of the hook.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.03,0:14:13.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the hook reaches the water, the glue will start to dissolve.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.10,0:14:16.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And by the time it gets tangled with Ejiri-san's fishing line,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.24,0:14:19.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The glue should mostly be gone. which is just perfect timing.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.94,0:14:25.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As for the evidence, there's a bit of glue on Ejiri-san's left sleeve.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.92,0:14:33.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He also said that there's a scratch mark on his left wrist.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.66,0:14:39.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think that caused Ejiri-san's fishing\Nrod tripod to fall into the water.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.20,0:14:46.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. It probably happened with the fishing line\Nwas pulled to make the hook scratch Ejiri-san.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.41,0:14:50.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The pulled fishing line moved the fishing rod, then\Npulled the fishing rod and the tripod into the sea.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.08,0:15:03.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course... If there are a lot of poisoned hooks on the line.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:03.68,0:15:07.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If the fishing line floats on the water's surface and follows the\Ncurrent, it'd be easy for it to get tangled up with a nearby line.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.23,0:15:20.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So? Which one is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.34,0:15:22.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Who did something like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.90,0:15:26.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Didn't I say it just now? The fishing line followed\Nthe current to tangle up with the line next to it.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.38,0:15:37.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, if Shirane-san at the\Nright side picked up the marker,

Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.39,0:15:48.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Correct. it's the person who was fishing between\NEjiri-san and us... Kanetani-san.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:55.74,0:15:59.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nonsense! Don't tell me you believe what these kids are saying.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:00.04,0:16:04.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, why would I want to kill someone on this pier?

Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.45,0:16:11.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, the low number of suspects was actually by accident.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.69,0:16:18.43,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At the time, we all thought something was weird when\NEjiri-san didn't move at all even when he had a bite.
