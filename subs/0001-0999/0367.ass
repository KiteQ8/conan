Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.25,0:06:25.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe he put the poison on the fishhook and cast\Nit so that it'd catch Ejiri{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} and poison him.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.27,0:06:45.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Nope, the possibility of that is very low.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.21,0:06:49.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Had something like poisoned food gone past his mouth,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.29,0:06:59.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then you already knew that the poison wasn't\Nintroduced through the mouth at the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.86,0:07:03.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, I couldn't tell where the poison was introduced\Njust by giving him a quick scan.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.46,0:07:08.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,All I know is that if I hadn't done artificial\Nrespiration on him at that time,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.35,0:07:31.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's all because you kept telling us to go faster and faster!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.62,0:07:34.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The police sure are slow...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.93,0:07:37.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah... But it should be okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.33,0:07:43.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit is one of those two for sure, so\Nwe just need to keep our eyes on them.
