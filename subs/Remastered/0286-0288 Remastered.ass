Dialogue: 0,0:23:02.51,0:23:07.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But this person was wearing a scarf and hat, so we don't even know if it was a man or a woman.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:08.34,0:23:11.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then that must be the killer.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:11.32,0:23:13.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why pick that seat?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:13.62,0:23:16.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Aren't those seats expensive?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:16.96,0:23:21.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The angle from that terrace isn't very good, so they're probably cheap.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:22.33,0:23:26.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And it's easy to leave an impression if someone with their face hidden asks for an entire area,

Dialogue: 0,0:23:44.24,0:23:47.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And there's blood in his right hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:47.24,0:23:51.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could the blood be from grabbing his chest after he was shot?

Dialogue: 0,0:24:51.62,0:24:52.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.87,0:24:58.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That laser sight was probably aimed not from the terrace, but from the stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:59.22,0:25:03.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In order to make us believe the gunshot came from there.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.21,0:25:09.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, the masked person purchasing the tickets, and the strange present
Dialogue: 0,0:25:09.95,0:25:15.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,were just a ruse to lead us to suspect someone was threatening the actresses.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:17.19,0:25:18.25,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see...
Dialogue: 0,0:25:18.25,0:25:20.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, this is part of the trick, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:23.62,0:25:27.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is where that armor fell before the play started, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:25:42.15,0:25:44.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then someone did it intentionally?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:44.65,0:25:50.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. The killer probably had a knife or similar in his shoe, and used it to cut the line,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:50.15,0:25:52.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,bringing down the armor.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:53.57,0:26:01.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The killer knew that we, Sharon's friends, would come this way during the guided tour.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:01.17,0:26:05.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means that the killer is one of those who was with us when the armor fell,

Dialogue: 0,0:27:52.38,0:27:56.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,but she was acting as if she'd collapsed from seeing the angel.
